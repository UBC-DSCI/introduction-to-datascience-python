    "## Randomness and seeds\n",
    "Beginning in this chapter, our data analyses will often involve the use\n",
    "of *randomness*. \\index{random} We use randomness any time we need to make a decision in our\n",
    "analysis that needs to be fair, unbiased, and not influenced by human input.\n",
    "For example, in this chapter, we need to split\n",
    "a data set into a training set and test set to evaluate our classifier. We \n",
    "certainly do not want to choose how to split\n",
    "the data ourselves by hand, as we want to avoid accidentally influencing the result\n",
    "of the evaluation. So instead, we let Python *randomly* split the data.\n",
    "In future chapters we will use randomness\n",
    "in many other ways, e.g., to help us select a small subset of data from a larger data set, \n",
    "to pick groupings of data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the use of randomness runs counter to one of the main \n",
    "tenets of good data analysis practice: \\index{reproducible} *reproducibility*. Recall that a reproducible\n",
    "analysis produces the same result each time it is run; if we include randomness\n",
    "in the analysis, would we not get a different result each time?\n",

    "### Finding a good subset of predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, if it is not ideal to use all of our variables as predictors without consideration, how \n",
    "do we choose which variables we *should* use?  A simple method is to rely on your scientific understanding\n",
    "of the data to tell you which variables are not likely to be useful predictors. For example, in the cancer\n",
    "data that we have been studying, the `ID` variable is just a unique identifier for the observation.\n",
    "As it is not related to any measured property of the cells, the `ID` variable should therefore not be used\n",
    "as a predictor. That is, of course, a very clear-cut case. But the decision for the remaining variables \n",
    "is less obvious, as all seem like reasonable candidates. It \n",
    "is not clear which subset of them will create the best classifier. One could use visualizations and\n",
    "other exploratory analyses to try to help understand which variables are potentially relevant, but\n",
    "this process is both time-consuming and error-prone when there are many variables to consider.\n",
    "Therefore we need a more systematic and programmatic way of choosing variables. \n",
    "This is a very difficult problem to solve in\n",
    "general, and there are a number of methods that have been developed that apply\n",
    "in particular cases of interest. Here we will discuss two basic\n",
    "selection methods as an introduction to the topic. See the additional resources at the end of\n",
    "this chapter to find out where you can learn more about variable selection, including more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first idea you might think of for a systematic way to select predictors\n",
    "is to try all possible subsets of predictors and then pick the set that results in the \"best\" classifier.\n",
    "This procedure is indeed a well-known variable selection method referred to \n",
    "as *best subset selection* [@bealesubset; @hockingsubset]. \\index{variable selection!best subset}\\index{predictor selection|see{variable selection}}\n",
    "In particular, you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a separate model for every possible subset of predictors,\n",
    "2. tune each one using cross-validation, and\n",
    "3. pick the subset of predictors that gives you the highest cross-validation accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Best subset selection is applicable to any classification method ($K$-NN or otherwise).\n",
    "However, it becomes very slow when you have even a moderate\n",
    "number of predictors to choose from (say, around 10). This is because the number of possible predictor subsets\n",
    "grows very quickly with the number of predictors, and you have to train the model (itself\n",
    "a slow process!) for each one. For example, if we have $2$ predictors&mdash;let's call\n",
    "them A and B&mdash;then we have 3 variable sets to try: A alone, B alone, and finally A\n",
    "and B together. If we have $3$ predictors&mdash;A, B, and C&mdash;then we have 7\n",
    "to try: A, B, C, AB, BC, AC, and ABC. In general, the number of models\n",
    "we have to train for $m$ predictors is $2^m-1$; in other words, when we \n",
    "get to $10$ predictors we have over *one thousand* models to train, and \n",
    "at $20$ predictors we have over *one million* models to train! \n",
    "So although it is a simple method, best subset selection is usually too computationally \n",
    "expensive to use in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to iteratively build up a model by adding one predictor variable \n",
    "at a time. This method&mdash;known as *forward selection* [@forwardefroymson; @forwarddraper]&mdash;is also widely \\index{variable selection!forward}\n",
    "applicable and fairly straightforward. It involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a model having no predictors.\n",
    "2. Run the following 3 steps until you run out of predictors:\n",
    "    1. For each unused predictor, add it to the model to form a *candidate model*.\n",
    "    2. Tune all of the candidate models.\n",
    "    3. Update the model to be the candidate model with the highest cross-validation accuracy.\n",
    "3. Select the model that provides the best trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have $m$ total predictors to work with. In the first iteration, you have to make\n",
    "$m$ candidate models, each with 1 predictor. Then in the second iteration, you have\n",
    "to make $m-1$ candidate models, each with 2 predictors (the one you chose before and a new one).\n",
    "This pattern continues for as many iterations as you want. If you run the method\n",
    "all the way until you run out of predictors to choose, you will end up training\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{2}m(m+1)$ separate models. This is a *big* improvement from the $2^m-1$\n",
    "models that best subset selection requires you to train! For example, while best subset selection requires\n",
    "training over 1000 candidate models with $m=10$ predictors, forward selection requires training only 55 candidate models.\n",
    " Therefore we will continue the rest of this section using forward selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** One word of caution before we move on. Every additional model that you train \n",
    "> increases the likelihood that you will get unlucky and stumble \n",
    "> on a model that has a high cross-validation accuracy estimate, but a low true\n",
    "> accuracy on the test data and other future observations.\n",
    "> Since forward selection involves training a lot of models, you run a fairly\n",
    "> high risk of this happening. To keep this risk low, only use forward selection\n",
    "> when you have a large amount of data and a relatively small total number of \n",
    "> predictors. More advanced methods do not suffer from this\n",
    "> problem as much; see the additional resources at the end of this chapter for\n",

    "## Additional resources\n",
    "- The [`tidymodels` website](https://tidymodels.org/packages) is an excellent\n",
    "  reference for more details on, and advanced usage of, the functions and\n",
    "  packages in the past two chapters. Aside from that, it also has a [nice\n",
    "  beginner's tutorial](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) and [an extensive list\n",
    "  of more advanced examples](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/) that you can use\n",
    "  to continue learning beyond the scope of this book. It's worth noting that the\n",
    "  `tidymodels` package does a lot more than just classification, and so the\n",
    "  examples on the website similarly go beyond classification as well. In the next\n",
    "  two chapters, you'll learn about another kind of predictive modeling setting,\n",
    "  so it might be worth visiting the website only after reading through those\n",
    "  chapters.\n",
    "- *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* [@james2013introduction] provides \n",
    "  a great next stop in the process of\n",
    "  learning about classification. Chapter 4 discusses additional basic techniques\n",
    "  for classification that we do not cover, such as logistic regression, linear\n",
    "  discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes. Chapter 5 goes into much more detail\n",
    "  about cross-validation. Chapters 8 and 9 cover decision trees and support\n",
    "  vector machines, two very popular but more advanced classification methods.\n",
    "  Finally, Chapter 6 covers a number of methods for selecting predictor\n",
    "  variables. Note that while this book is still a very accessible introductory\n",
    "  text, it requires a bit more mathematical background than we require."
