# About the editors of the Python Edition

**Trevor Campbell** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at
the University of British Columbia. His research focuses on automated, scalable
Bayesian inference algorithms, Bayesian nonparametrics, streaming data, and
Bayesian theory. He was previously a postdoctoral associate advised by Tamara
Broderick in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, a Ph.D.
candidate under Jonathan How in the Laboratory for Information and Decision
Systems (LIDS) at MIT, and before that he was in the Engineering Science
program at the University of Toronto.

**Lindsey Heagy** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric 
Sciences and director of the Geophysical Inversion Facility at the University of British Columbia. 
Her research combines computational methods in numerical simulations, inversions, and machine 
learning to answer questions about the subsurface of the Earth. Primary applications include 
mineral exploration, carbon sequestration, groundwater and environmental studies. She 
completed her BSc at the University of Alberta, her PhD at the University of British Columbia, 
and held a Postdoctoral research position at the University of California Berkeley prior to 
starting her current position at UBC.

**Joel Ostblom** is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of
Statistics at the University of British Columbia. 
During his PhD, Joel developed a passion for data science and reproducibility
through the development of quantitative image analysis pipelines for studying
stem cell and developmental biology. He has since co-created or lead the
development of several courses and workshops at the University of Toronto and
is now an assistant professor of teaching in the statistics department at the
University of British Columbia. Joel cares deeply about spreading data literacy
and excitement over programmatic data analysis, which is reflected in his
contributions to open source projects and data science learning resources. You
can read more about Joel on his [personal page](https://joelostblom.com/).
