    "# Effective data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "This chapter will introduce concepts and tools relating to data visualization\n",
    "beyond what we have seen and practiced so far.  We will focus on guiding\n",
    "principles for effective data visualization and explaining visualizations\n",
    "independent of any particular tool or programming language.  In the process, we\n",
    "will cover some specifics of creating visualizations (scatter plots, bar\n",
    "plots, line plots, and histograms) for data using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a data set and a question, select from the above plot types and use Python to create a visualization that best answers the question.\n",
    "- Given a visualization and a question, evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization and suggest improvements to better answer the question.\n",
    "- Referring to the visualization, communicate the conclusions in non-technical terms.\n",
    "- Identify rules of thumb for creating effective visualizations. \n",
    "- Define the two key aspects of altair objects:\n",
    "    - mark objects\n",
    "    - encodings\n",
    "- Use the altair library in Python to create and refine the above visualizations using:\n",
    "    - mark objects: mark_point, mark_line, mark_bar\n",
    "    - encodings : x, y, fill, color, shape\n",
    "    - subplots: facet\n",
    "- Describe the difference in raster and vector output formats.\n",
    "- Use `chart.save()` to save visualizations in `.png` and `.svg` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the visualization\n",
    "#### *Ask a question, and answer it* {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a visualization is to answer a question\n",
    "\\index{question!visualization} about a data set of interest. So naturally, the\n",
    "first thing to do **before** creating a visualization is to formulate the\n",
    "question about the data you are trying to answer.  A good visualization will\n",
    "clearly answer your question without distraction; a *great* visualization will\n",
    "suggest even what the question was itself without additional explanation.\n",
    "Imagine your visualization as part of a poster presentation for a project; even\n",
    "if you aren't standing at the poster explaining things, an effective\n",
    "visualization will convey your message to the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the different data analysis questions \n",
    "from Chapter \\@ref(intro). \n",
    "With the visualizations we will cover in this chapter, \n",
    "we will be able to answer *only descriptive and exploratory* questions. \n",
    "Be careful to not answer any *predictive, inferential, causal* \n",
    "*or mechanistic* questions with the visualizations presented here, \n",
    "as we have not learned the tools necessary to do that properly just yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with most coding tasks, it is totally fine (and quite common) to make\n",
    "mistakes and iterate a few times before you find the right visualization for\n",
    "your data and question. There are many different kinds of plotting\n",
    "graphics available to use (see Chapter 5 of *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@wilkeviz] for a directory). \n",
    "The types of plot that we introduce in this book are shown in {numref}`plot_sketches`\n",
    "which one you should select depends on your data \n",
    "and the question you want to answer. \n",
    "In general, the guiding principles of when to use each type of plot \n",
    "are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\index{visualization!line}\n",
    "\\index{visualization!histogram}\n",
    "\\index{visualization!scatter}\n",
    "\\index{visualization!bar}\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scatter plots** visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables\n",
    "- **line plots** visualize trends with respect to an independent, ordered quantity (e.g., time)\n",
    "- **bar plots** visualize comparisons of amounts\n",
    "- **histograms** visualize the distribution of one quantitative variable (i.e., all its possible values and how often they occur) \\index{distribution}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} img/plot-sketches-1.png\n",

    "All types of visualization have their (mis)uses, but three kinds are usually\n",
    "hard to understand or are easily replaced with an oft-better alternative.  In\n",
    "particular, you should avoid **pie charts**; it is generally better to use\n",
    "bars, as it is easier to compare bar heights than pie slice sizes.  You should\n",
    "also not use **3-D visualizations**, as they are typically hard to understand\n",
    "when converted to a static 2-D image format. Finally, do not use tables to make\n",
    "numerical comparisons; humans are much better at quickly processing visual\n",
    "information than text and math. Bar plots are again typically a better\n",
    "alternative."

    "## Refining the visualization\n",
    "#### *Convey the message, minimize noise* {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "Just being able to make a visualization in Python with `altair` (or any other tool\n",
    "for that matter) doesn't mean that it effectively communicates your message to\n",
    "others. Once you have selected a broad type of visualization to use, you will\n",
    "have to refine it to suit your particular need.  Some rules of thumb for doing\n",
    "this are listed below. They generally fall into two classes: you want to \n",
    "*make your visualization convey your message*, and you want to *reduce visual noise*\n",
    "as much as possible. Humans have limited cognitive ability to process\n",
    "information; both of these types of refinement aim to reduce the mental load on\n",
    "your audience when viewing your visualization, making it easier for them to\n",
    "understand and remember your message quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convey the message**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the visualization answers the question you have asked most simply and plainly as possible.\n",
    "- Use legends and labels so that your visualization is understandable without reading the surrounding text.\n",
    "- Ensure the text, symbols, lines, etc., on your visualization are big enough to be easily read.\n",
    "- Ensure the data are clearly visible; don't hide the shape/distribution of the data behind other objects (e.g.,  a bar).\n",
    "- Make sure to use color schemes that are understandable by those with\n",
    "  colorblindness (a surprisingly large fraction of the overall \n",
    "  population&mdash;from about 1% to 10%, depending on sex and ancestry [@deebblind]).\n",
    "  For example, [Color Schemes](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/) \n",
    "  provides the ability to pick such color schemes, and you can check\n",
    "  your visualizations after you have created them by uploading to online tools\n",
    "  such as a [color blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).\n",
    "- Redundancy can be helpful; sometimes conveying the same message in multiple ways reinforces it for the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimize noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use colors sparingly. Too many different colors can be distracting, create false patterns, and detract from the message. \n",
    "- Be wary of overplotting. Overplotting is when marks that represent the data\n",
    "  overlap, and is problematic as it prevents you from seeing how many data\n",
    "  points are represented in areas of the visualization where this occurs. If your\n",
    "  plot has too many dots or lines and starts to look like a mess, you need to do\n",
    "  something different.\n",
    "- Only make the plot area (where the dots, lines, bars are) as big as needed. Simple plots can be made small.\n",
    "- Don't adjust the axes to zoom in on small differences. If the difference is small, show that it's small!"

    "\\index{ggplot!aesthetic mapping}\n",
    "\\index{ggplot!geometric object}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the **data frame** object to visualize.\n",
    "    - Here, we specify the `co2_df` data frame as an argument to the `alt.Chart()` function\n",
    "- The **geometric object**, which specifies \\index{aesthetic mapping} how the mapped data should be displayed.\n",
    "    - To create a geometric object, we use `Chart.mark_*` methods (see the [altair reference](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html) for a list of geometric objects).\n",
    "    - Here, we use the `mark_point` function to visualize our data as a scatter plot.\n",
    "- The **geometric encoding**, which tells \\index{aesthetic mapping} `altair` how the columns in the data frame map to properties of the visualization.\n",
    "    - To create an encoding, we use the `encode()` function.\n",
    "    - The `encode()` method builds a key-value mapping between encoding channels (such as x, y) to fields in the dataset, accessed by field name(column names)\n",
    "    - Here, we set the plot `x` axis to the `date_measured` variable, and the plot `y` axis to the `ppm` variable."

    "Interesting! It seems that each year, the atmospheric CO$_{\\text{2}}$ increases until it reaches its peak somewhere around April, decreases until around late September, \n",
    "and finally increases again until the end of the year. In Hawaii, there are two seasons: summer from May through October, and winter from November through April.\n",
    "Therefore, the oscillating pattern in CO$_{\\text{2}}$ matches up fairly closely with the two seasons.\n",

    "As you might have noticed from the code used to create the final visualization\n",

    "In our data visualization, \n",
    "this would be the geometric objects (e.g., `mark_point`, `mark_line`, etc.).\n",
    "And finally, we work on adding details and refinements to the painting.\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`can_lang_plot_percent` is the appropriate\n",
    "visualization to use to answer the first question in this section, i.e.,\n",
    "whether there is a relationship between the percentage of people who speak \n",
    "a language as their mother tongue and the percentage for whom that\n",
    "is the primary language spoken at home.\n",
    "To fully answer the question, we need to use\n",
    " {numref}`can_lang_plot_percent`\n",
    "to assess a few key characteristics of the data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direction:** if the y variable tends to increase when the x variable increases, then y has a **positive** relationship with x. If \n",
    "  y tends to decrease when x increases, then y has a **negative** relationship with x. If y does not meaningfully increase or decrease \n",
    "  as x increases, then y has **little or no** relationship with x. \\index{relationship!positive, negative, none}\n",
    "- **Strength:** if the y variable *reliably* increases, decreases, or stays flat as x increases,\n",
    "  then the relationship is **strong**. Otherwise, the relationship is **weak**. Intuitively, \\index{relationship!strong, weak}\n",
    "  the relationship is strong when the scatter points are close together and look more like a \"line\" or \"curve\" than a \"cloud.\"\n",
    "- **Shape:** if you can draw a straight line roughly through the data points, the relationship is **linear**. Otherwise, it is **nonlinear**. \\index{relationship!linear, nonlinear}\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`can_lang_plot_percent`, we see that \n",
    "as the percentage of people who have a language as their mother tongue increases, \n",
    "so does the percentage of people who speak that language at home. \n",
    "Therefore, there is a **positive** relationship between these two variables.\n",
    "Furthermore, because the points in {numref}`can_lang_plot_percent`\n",
    "are fairly close together, and the points look more like a \"line\" than a \"cloud\",\n",
    "we can say that this is a **strong** relationship. \n",
    "And finally, because drawing a straight line through these points in \n",
    "{numref}`can_lang_plot_percent`\n",
    "would fit the pattern we observe quite well, we say that the relationship is **linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onto the second part of our exploratory data analysis question!\n",
    "Recall that we are interested in knowing whether the strength \n",
    "of the relationship we uncovered \n",
    "in {numref}`can_lang_plot_percent` depends\n",
    "on the higher-level language category (Official languages, Aboriginal languages,\n",
    "and non-official, non-Aboriginal languages).\n",
    "One common way to explore this\n",
    "is to color the data points on the scatter plot we have already created by\n",
    "group. For example, given that we have the higher-level language category for\n",
    "each language recorded in the 2016 Canadian census, we can color the points in\n",
    "our previous \n",
    "scatter plot to represent each language's higher-level language category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we want to distinguish the values according to the `category` group with\n",
    "which they belong.  We can add the argument `color` to the `encode` function, specifying\n",
    "that the `category` column should color the points. Adding this argument will\n",
    "color the points according to their group and add a legend at the side of the\n",
    "plot."

    "#### Choosing a binwidth for histograms {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a histogram in `altair`, the default number of bins used is 30.\n",
    "Naturally, this is not always the right number to use.\n",
    "You can set the number of bins yourself by using\n",
    "the `maxbins` argument in the `mark_bar` geometric object.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what number of bins is the right one to use? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there is no hard rule for what the right bin number\n",
    "or width is. It depends entirely on your problem; the *right* number of bins \n",
    "or bin width is \n",
    "the one that *helps you answer the question* you asked. \n",
    "Choosing the correct setting for your problem \n",
    "is something that commonly takes iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's usually a good idea to try out several `maxbins` to see which one\n",
    "most clearly captures your data in the context of the question\n",
    "you want to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense for how different bin affect visualizations, \n",
    "let's experiment with the histogram that we have been working on in this section.\n",
    "In {numref}`final_plot_max_bins`,\n",
    "we compare the default setting with three other histograms where we set the \n",
    "`maxbins` to 200, 70 and 5.\n",
    "In this case, we can see that both the default number of bins \n",
    "and the `maxbins=70` of  are effective for helping answer our question.\n",
    "On the other hand, the `maxbins=200` and `maxbins=5` are too small and too big, respectively."

    "suggest directions for future work. \n",

    "1) Establish the setting and scope, and describe why you did what you did. \n",
    "2) Pose the question that your visualization answers. Justify why the question is important to answer.\n",
    "3) Answer the question using your visualization. Make sure you describe *all* aspects of the visualization (including describing the axes). But you \n",
    "   can emphasize different aspects based on what is important to answer your question:\n",
    "    - **trends (lines):** Does a line describe the trend well? If so, the trend is *linear*, and if not, the trend is *nonlinear*. Is the trend increasing, decreasing, or neither?\n",
    "                        Is there a periodic oscillation (wiggle) in the trend? Is the trend noisy (does the line \"jump around\" a lot) or smooth?\n",
    "    - **distributions (scatters, histograms):** How spread out are the data? Where are they centered, roughly? Are there any obvious \"clusters\" or \"subgroups\", which would be visible as multiple bumps in the histogram?\n",
    "    - **distributions of two variables (scatters):** Is there a clear / strong relationship between the variables (points fall in a distinct pattern), a weak one (points fall in a pattern but there is some noise), or no discernible\n",
    "      relationship (the data are too noisy to make any conclusion)?\n",
    "    - **amounts (bars):** How large are the bars relative to one another? Are there patterns in different groups of bars? \n",
