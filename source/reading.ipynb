    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you’ll learn to read tabular data of various formats into Python\n",
    "from your local device (e.g., your laptop) and the web. “Reading” (or “loading”)\n",
    "\\index{loading|see{reading}}\\index{reading!definition} is the process of\n",
    "converting data (stored as plain text, a database, HTML, etc.) into an object\n",
    "(e.g., a data frame) that Python can easily access and manipulate. Thus reading data\n",
    "is the gateway to any data analysis; you won’t be able to analyze data unless\n",
    "you’ve loaded it first. And because there are many ways to store data, there\n",
    "are similarly many ways to read data into Python. The more time you spend upfront\n",
    "matching the data reading method to the type of data you have, the less time\n",
    "you will have to devote to re-formatting, cleaning and wrangling your data (the\n",
    "second step to all data analyses). It’s like making sure your shoelaces are\n",
    "tied well before going for a run so that you don’t trip later on!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the following:\n",
    "    - absolute file path\n",
    "    - relative file path\n",
    "    - **U**niform **R**esource **L**ocator (URL)\n",
    "- Read data into Python using an absolute path, relative path and a URL.\n",
    "- Compare and contrast the following functions:\n",
    "    - `read_csv` \n",
    "    - `read_table`\n",
    "    - `read_excel`\n",
    "- Match the following `pandas` `.read_*` function arguments to their descriptions:\n",
    "    - `filepath_or_buffer` \n",
    "    - `sep`\n",
    "    - `names`\n",
    "    - `skiprows`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate `pandas` `.read_*` function and function arguments to load a given plain text tabular data set into Python.\n",
    "- Use `pandas` package's `read_excel` function and arguments to load a sheet from an excel file into Python.\n",
    "- Connect to a database using the `SQLAlchemy` library.\n",
    "- List the tables in a database using `SQLAlchemy` library's `table_names` function\n",
    "- Create a reference to a database table that is queriable using the `SQLAlchemy` library's `select` \n",
    "and `where` functions\n",
    "- Use `.to_csv` to save a data frame to a csv file\n",
    "- (*Optional*) Obtain data using **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterfaces (APIs) and web scraping.\n",
    "    - Read/scrape data from an internet URL using the `BeautifulSoup` package\n",
    "    - Compare downloading tabular data from a plain text file (e.g. *.csv) from the web versus scraping data from a .html file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Absolute and relative file paths\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will discuss the different functions we can use to import data\n",
    "into Python, but before we can talk about *how* we read the data into Python with these\n",
    "functions, we first need to talk about *where* the data lives. When you load a\n",
    "data set into Python, you first need to tell Python where those files live. The file\n",
    "could live on your  computer (*local*) \n",
    "\\index{location|see{path}} \\index{path!local, remote, relative, absolute} \n",
    "or somewhere on the internet (*remote*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The place where the file lives on your computer is called the \"path\". You can\n",
    "think of the path as directions to the file. There are two kinds of paths:\n",
    "*relative* paths and *absolute* paths. A relative path is where the file is\n",
    "with respect to where you currently are on the computer (e.g., where the file\n",
    "you're working in is). On the other hand, an absolute path is where the file is\n",
    "in respect to the computer's filesystem base (or root) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our computer's filesystem looks like the picture in\n",
    "{numref}`Filesystem`, and we are working in a\n",
    "file titled `worksheet_02.ipynb`. If we want to \n",
    "read the `.csv` file named `happiness_report.csv` into Python, we could do this\n",
    "using either a relative or an absolute path.  We show both choices\n",
    "below.\\index{Happiness Report}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} img/filesystem.jpeg\n",
    "---\n",
    "height: 400px\n",
    "name: Filesystem\n",
    "---\n",
    "Example file system\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading `happiness_report.csv` using a relative path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell eval=False} ipython3\n",
    "happy_data = pd.read_csv(\"data/happiness_report.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading `happiness_report.csv` using an absolute path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell eval=False} ipython3\n",
    "happy_data = pd.read_csv(\"/home/dsci-100/worksheet_02/data/happiness_report.csv\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So which one should you use? Generally speaking, to ensure your code can be run \n",
    "on a different computer, you should use relative paths. An added bonus is that \n",
    "it's also less typing! Generally, you should use relative paths because the file's \n",
    "absolute path (the names of \n",
    "folders between the computer's root `/` and the file) isn't usually the same \n",
    "across different computers. For example, suppose Fatima and Jayden are working on a \n",
    "project together on the `happiness_report.csv` data. Fatima's file is stored at \n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/Fatima/project/data/happiness_report.csv`, \n",
    "\n",
    "while Jayden's is stored at \n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/Jayden/project/data/happiness_report.csv`.\n",
    " \n",
    "Even though Fatima and Jayden stored their files in the same place on their\n",
    "computers (in their home folders), the absolute paths are different due to\n",
    "their different usernames.  If Jayden has code that loads the\n",
    "`happiness_report.csv` data using an absolute path, the code won't work on\n",
    "Fatima's computer.  But the relative path from inside the `project` folder\n",
    "(`data/happiness_report.csv`) is the same on both computers; any code that uses\n",
    "relative paths will work on both!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your file could be stored locally, as we discussed, or it could also be\n",
    "somewhere on the internet (remotely). A *Uniform Resource Locator (URL)* (web\n",
    "address) \\index{URL} indicates the location of a resource on the internet and\n",
    "helps us retrieve that resource. Next, we will discuss how to get either\n",
    "locally or remotely stored data into Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading tabular data from a plain text file into Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### `read_csv` to read in comma-separated files {#readcsv}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned about *where* data could be, we will learn about *how*\n",
    "to import data into Python using various functions. Specifically, we will learn how \n",
    "to *read* tabular data from a plain text file (a document containing only text)\n",
    "*into* Python and *write* tabular data to a file *out of* Python. The function we use to do this\n",
    "depends on the file's format. For example, in the last chapter, we learned about using\n",
    "the `pandas` `read_csv` function when reading .csv (**c**omma-**s**eparated **v**alues)\n",
    "files. \\index{csv} In that case, the separator or *delimiter* \\index{reading!delimiter} that divided our columns was a\n",
    "comma (`,`). We only learned the case where the data matched the expected defaults \n",
    "of the `read_csv` function \\index{read function!read\\_csv}\n",
    "(column names are present, and commas are used as the delimiter between columns). \n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to read \n",
    "files that do not satisfy the default expectations of `read_csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into the cases where the data aren't in the expected default format \n",
    "for `pandas` and `read_csv`, let's revisit the more straightforward\n",
    "case where the defaults hold, and the only argument we need to give to the function\n",
    "is the path to the file, `data/can_lang.csv`. The `can_lang` data set contains \n",
    "language data from the 2016 Canadian census. \\index{Canadian languages!canlang data} \n",
    "We put `data/` before the file's\n",
    "name when we are loading the data set because this data set is located in a\n",
    "sub-folder, named `data`, relative to where we are running our Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the file would look like in a plain text editor (a program that removes\n",
    "all formatting, like bolding or different fonts):\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",

    "## Reading data from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very common form of data storage is the relational database. Databases\n",
    "\\index{database} are great when you have large data sets or multiple users\n",
    "working on a project. There are many relational database management systems,\n",
    "such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more. These\n",
    "different relational database management systems each have their own advantages\n",
    "and limitations. Almost all employ SQL (*structured query language*) to obtain\n",
    "data from the database. But you don't need to know SQL to analyze data from\n",
    "a database; several packages have been written that allow you to connect to\n",
    "relational databases and use the Python programming language \n",
    "to obtain data. In this book, we will give examples of how to do this\n",
    "using Python with SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading data from a SQLite database\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite \\index{database!SQLite} is probably the simplest relational database system\n",
    "that one can use in combination with Python. SQLite databases are self-contained and\n",
    "usually stored and accessed locally on one computer. Data is usually stored in\n",
    "a file with a `.db` extension. Similar to Excel files, these are not plain text\n",
    "files and cannot be read in a plain text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do to read data into Python from a database is to\n",
    "connect to the database. We do that using the `create_engine` function from the\n",
    "`sal` (SQLAlchemy) package. \\index{database!connect} This does not read\n",
    "in the data, but simply tells Python where the database is and opens up a\n",
    "communication channel that Python can use to send SQL commands to the database."

    "> **Note:** This section is not required reading for the remainder of the textbook. It\n",
    "> is included for those readers interested in learning a little bit more about\n",
    "> how to obtain different types of data from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data doesn't just magically appear on your computer; you need to get it from\n",
    "somewhere. Earlier in the chapter we showed you how to access data stored in a\n",
    "plain text, spreadsheet-like format (e.g., comma- or tab-separated) from a web\n",
    "URL using one of the `read_*` functions from the `tidyverse`. But as time goes\n",
    "on, it is increasingly uncommon to find data (especially large amounts of data)\n",
    "in this format available for download from a URL. Instead, websites now often\n",
    "offer something known as an **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterface\n",
    "(API), \\index{application programming interface|see{API}}\\index{API} which\n",
    "provides a programmatic way to ask for subsets of a data set. This allows the\n",
    "website owner to control *who* has access to the data, *what portion* of the\n",
    "data they have access to, and *how much* data they can access.  Typically, the\n",
    "website owner will give you a *token* (a secret string of characters somewhat\n",
    "like a password) that you have to provide when accessing the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thought: websites themselves *are* data! When you type a\n",
    "URL into your browser window, your browser asks the *web server* (another\n",
    "computer on the internet whose job it is to respond to requests for the\n",
    "website) to give it the website's data, and then your browser translates that\n",
    "data into something you can see. If the website shows you some information that\n",
    "you're interested in, you could *create* a data set for yourself by copying and\n",
    "pasting that information into a file. This process of taking information\n",
    "directly from what a website displays is called \\index{web scraping} \n",
    "*web scraping* (or sometimes *screen scraping*). Now, of course, copying and pasting\n",
    "information manually is a painstaking and error-prone process, especially when\n",
    "there is a lot of information to gather. So instead of asking your browser to\n",
    "translate the information that the web server provides into something you can\n",
    "see, you can collect that data programmatically&mdash;in the form of\n",
    "**h**yper**t**ext **m**arkup **l**anguage \n",

    "and **c**ascading **s**tyle **s**heet (CSS) code&mdash;and process it \n",
    "to extract useful information. HTML provides the\n",
    "basic structure of a site and tells the webpage how to display the content\n",
    "(e.g., titles, paragraphs, bullet lists etc.), whereas CSS helps style the\n",

    "for humans to understand easily. However, if you look through it closely, you\n",
    "will find that the information we're interested in is hidden among the muck.\n",
    "For example, near the top of the snippet\n",
    "above you can see a line that looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<span class=\"result-price\">$800</span>\n",
    "```\n",

    "listing, the address of the listing, and more. So this source code most likely\n",
    "contains all the information we are interested in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into that line \\index{HTML!tag} above a bit more. You can see that\n",
    "that bit of code has an *opening tag* (words between `<` and `>`, like\n",
    "`<span>`) and a *closing tag* (the same with a slash, like `</span>`). HTML\n",
    "source code generally stores its data between opening and closing tags like\n",
    "these. Tags are keywords that tell the web browser how to display or format\n",
    "the content. Above you can see that the information we want (`$800`) is stored\n",
    "between an opening and closing tag (`<span>` and `</span>`). In the opening\n",
    "tag, you can also see a very useful \"class\" (a special word that is sometimes\n",
    "included with opening tags): `class=\"result-price\"`. Since we want R to\n",
    "programmatically sort through all of the source code for the website to find\n",
    "apartment prices, maybe we can look for all the tags with the `\"result-price\"`\n",
    "class, and grab the information between the opening and closing tag. Indeed,\n",
    "take a look at another line of the source snippet above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<span class=\"result-price\">$2285</span>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's yet another price for an apartment listing, and the tags surrounding it\n",

    "\n",
    "Rather than posting a data file at a URL for you to download, many websites these days\n",

    "is that data owners have much more control over the data they provide to users. However, unlike\n",

    "has its own API designed especially for its own use case. Therefore we will just provide one example\n",
    "of accessing data through an API in this book, with the hope that it gives you enough of a basic\n",
    "idea that you can learn how to use another API if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in this book we will show you the basics of how to use\n",
    "the `rtweet` package in R\\index{API!rtweet}\\index{rtweet}\\index{Twitter} to access\n",
    "data from the Twitter API. One nice feature of this particular \n",
    "API is that you don't need  a special *token* \\index{API!token} to access it; you simply need to \n",
    "make an account with them. Your access to the data will then be authenticated and controlled through\n",
    "your account username and password. If you have a Twitter \n",
    "account already (or are willing to make one), you can follow\n",
    "along with the examples that we show here. To get started, load the `rtweet` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "library(rtweet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides an extensive set of functions to search \n",

    "careful, but you should try to prevent issues from happening in the first place by being extra careful\n",
    "with how you write and run your code. You should also keep in mind that when a website owner\n",
    "grants you API access, they also usually specify a limit (or *quota*) of how much data you can ask for.\n",
    "Be careful not to overrun your quota! In this example, we should take a look at\n",

    "\n",
    "After checking the Twitter website, it seems like asking for 400 tweets one time is acceptable.\n",
