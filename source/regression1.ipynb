    "## The regression problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression, like classification, is a predictive \\index{predictive question} problem setting where we want\n",
    "to use past information to predict future observations. But in the case of\n",
    "regression, the goal is to predict *numerical* values instead of *categorical* values. \n",
    "The variable that you want to predict is often called the *response variable*. \\index{response variable}\n",
    "For example, we could try to use the number of hours a person spends on\n",
    "exercise each week to predict their race time in the annual Boston marathon. As \n",
    "another example, we could try to use the size of a house to\n",
    "predict its sale price. Both of these response variables&mdash;race time and sale price&mdash;are \n",
    "numerical, and so predicting them given past data is considered a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the \\index{classification!comparison to regression} \n",
    "classification setting, there are many possible methods that we can use \n",
    "to predict numerical response variables. In this chapter we will\n",
    "focus on the **K-nearest neighbors** algorithm {cite:p}`knnfix,knncover`, and in the next chapter\n",
    "we will study **linear regression**.\n",
    "In your future studies, you might encounter regression trees, splines,\n",
    "and general local regression methods; see the additional resources\n",
    "section at the end of the next chapter for where to begin learning more about\n",
    "these other methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts from classification map over to the setting of regression. For example, \n",
    "a regression model predicts a new observation's response variable based on the response variables\n",
    "for similar observations in the data set of past observations. When building a regression model,\n",
    "we first split the data into training and test sets, in order to ensure that we assess the performance\n",
    "of our method on observations not seen during training. And finally, we can use cross-validation to evaluate different\n",
    "choices of model parameters (e.g., K in a K-nearest neighbors model). The major difference\n",
    "is that we are now predicting numerical variables instead of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You can usually tell whether a\\index{categorical variable}\\index{numerical variable} variable is numerical or\n",
    "> categorical&mdash;and therefore whether you need to perform regression or\n",
    "> classification&mdash;by taking two response variables X and Y from your data,\n",
    "> and asking the question, \"is response variable X *more* than response\n",
    "> variable Y?\" If the variable is categorical, the question will make no sense.\n",
    "> (Is blue more than red?  Is benign more than malignant?) If the variable is\n",
    "> numerical, it will make sense. (Is 1.5 hours more than 2.25 hours? Is\n",
    "> \\$500,000 more than \\$400,000?) Be careful when applying this heuristic,\n",
    "> though: sometimes categorical variables will be encoded as numbers in your\n",
    "> data (e.g., \"1\" represents \"benign\", and \"0\" represents \"malignant\"). In\n",
    "> these cases you have to ask the question about the *meaning* of the labels\n",
    "> (\"benign\" and \"malignant\"), not their values (\"1\" and \"0\")."
