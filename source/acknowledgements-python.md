# Acknowledgments for the Python Edition

We'd like to thank everyone that has contributed to the development of
[*Data Science: A First Introduction (Python Edition)*](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience-python/).
This is an open source Python translation of the original [*Data Science: A First Introduction*](https://datasciencebook.ca);
the original focused on the R programming language. Both of these books are
used to teach DSCI 100, a new introductory data science course
at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

We will finalize this acknowledgements section after the book is complete!
