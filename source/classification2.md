## Overview 
This chapter continues the introduction to predictive modeling through
classification. While the previous chapter covered training and data
preprocessing, this chapter focuses on how to evaluate the performance of
a classifier, as well as how to improve the classifier (where possible)
to maximize its accuracy.

## Chapter learning objectives 
By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:

- Describe what training, validation, and test data sets are and how they are used in classification.
- Split data into training, validation, and test data sets.
- Describe what a random seed is and its importance in reproducible data analysis.
- Set the random seed in Python using the `numpy.random.seed` function. 
- Describe and interpret accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
- Evaluate classification accuracy in Python using a validation data set.
- Produce a confusion matrix in Python.
- Execute cross-validation in Python to choose the number of neighbors in a $K$-nearest neighbors classifier.
- Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the $K$-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.

## Evaluating performance

```{index} breast cancer
```

Sometimes our classifier might make the wrong prediction. A classifier does not
need to be right 100\% of the time to be useful, though we don't want the
classifier to make too many wrong predictions. How do we measure how "good" our
classifier is? Let's revisit the 
[breast cancer images data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) {cite:p}`streetbreastcancer`
and think about how our classifier will be used in practice. A biopsy will be
performed on a *new* patient's tumor, the resulting image will be analyzed,
and the classifier will be asked to decide whether the tumor is benign or
malignant. The key word here is *new*: our classifier is "good" if it provides
accurate predictions on data *not seen during training*, as this implies that
it has actually learned about the relationship between the predictor variables and response variable,
as opposed to simply memorizing the labels of individual training data examples. 
But then, how can we evaluate our classifier without visiting the hospital to collect more
tumor images? 


```{index} training set, test set
```

The trick is to split the data into a **training set** and **test set** ({numref}`fig:06-training-test`)
and use only the **training set** when building the classifier.
Then, to evaluate the performance of the classifier, we first set aside the true labels from the **test set**,
and then use the classifier to predict the labels in the **test set**. If our predictions match the true
labels for the observations in the **test set**, then we have some
confidence that our classifier might also accurately predict the class
labels for new observations without known class labels.

```{index} golden rule of machine learning
```

```{note}
If there were a golden rule of machine learning, it might be this: 
*you cannot use the test data to build the model!* If you do, the model gets to
"see" the test data in advance, making it look more accurate than it really
is. Imagine how bad it would be to overestimate your classifier's accuracy
when predicting whether a patient's tumor is malignant or benign!

```{index} accuracy
```

How exactly can we assess how well our predictions match the true labels for
the observations in the test set? One way we can do this is to calculate the
prediction **accuracy**. This is the fraction of examples for which the
classifier made the correct prediction. To calculate this, we divide the number
of correct predictions by the number of predictions made. 
The process for assessing if our predictions match the true labels in the 
test set is illustrated in {numref}`fig:06-ML-paradigm-test`.

$$\mathrm{accuracy} = \frac{\mathrm{number \; of  \; correct  \; predictions}}{\mathrm{total \;  number \;  of  \; predictions}}$$

+++

```{figure} img/classification2/ML-paradigm-test.png
:name: fig:06-ML-paradigm-test

Process for splitting the data and finding the prediction accuracy.
```

Accuracy is a convenient, general-purpose way to summarize the performance of a classifier with
a single number.  But prediction accuracy by itself does not tell the whole
story.  In particular, accuracy alone only tells us how often the classifier
makes mistakes in general, but does not tell us anything about the *kinds* of
mistakes the classifier makes.  A more comprehensive view of performance can be
obtained by additionally examining the **confusion matrix**. The confusion
matrix shows how many test set labels of each type are predicted correctly and
incorrectly, which gives us more detail about the kinds of mistakes the
classifier tends to make.  {numref}`confusion-matrix-table` shows an example
of what a confusion matrix might look like for the tumor image data with
a test set of 65 observations.

```{list-table} An example confusion matrix for the tumor image data.
:header-rows: 1
:name: confusion-matrix-table

* - 
  - Predicted Malignant
  - Predicted Benign
* - **Truly Malignant**
  - 1
  - 3
* - **Truly Benign**
  - 4
  - 57
``` 

In the example in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`, we see that there was
1 malignant observation that was correctly classified as malignant (top left corner),
and 57 benign observations that were correctly classified as benign (bottom right corner).
However, we can also see that the classifier made some mistakes:
it classified 3 malignant observations as benign, and 4 benign observations as
malignant. The accuracy of this classifier is roughly
89%, given by the formula

$$\mathrm{accuracy} = \frac{\mathrm{number \; of  \; correct  \; predictions}}{\mathrm{total \;  number \;  of  \; predictions}} = \frac{1+57}{1+57+4+3} = 0.892$$

But we can also see that the classifier only identified 1 out of 4 total malignant
tumors; in other words, it misclassified 75% of the malignant cases present in the
data set! In this example, misclassifying a malignant tumor is a potentially
disastrous error, since it may lead to a patient who requires treatment not receiving it.
Since we are particularly interested in identifying malignant cases, this 
classifier would likely be unacceptable even with an accuracy of 89%.

Focusing more on one label than the other is
common in classification problems. In such cases, we typically refer to the label we are more
interested in identifying as the *positive* label, and the other as the
*negative* label. In the tumor example, we would refer to malignant
observations as *positive*, and benign observations as *negative*.  We can then
use the following terms to talk about the four kinds of prediction that the
classifier can make, corresponding to the four entries in the confusion matrix:

- **True Positive:** A malignant observation that was classified as malignant (top left in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`).
- **False Positive:** A benign observation that was classified as malignant (bottom left in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`).
- **True Negative:** A benign observation that was classified as benign (bottom right in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`).
- **False Negative:** A malignant observation that was classified as benign (top right in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`).

A perfect classifier would have zero false negatives and false positives (and
therefore, 100% accuracy). However, classifiers in practice will almost always
make some errors. So you should think about which kinds of error are most
important in your application, and use the confusion matrix to quantify and
report them. Two commonly used metrics that we can compute using the confusion
matrix are the **precision** and **recall** of the classifier. These are often
reported together with accuracy.  *Precision* quantifies how many of the
positive predictions the classifier made were actually positive. Intuitively,
we would like a classifier to have a *high* precision: for a classifier with
high precision, if the classifier reports that a new observation is positive,
we can trust that the new observation is indeed positive. We can compute the
precision of a classifier using the entries in the confusion matrix, with the
formula

$$\mathrm{precision} = \frac{\mathrm{number \; of  \; correct \; positive \; predictions}}{\mathrm{total \;  number \;  of \; positive  \; predictions}}.$$

*Recall* quantifies how many of the positive observations in the test set were
identified as positive. Intuitively, we would like a classifier to have a
*high* recall: for a classifier with high recall, if there is a positive
observation in the test data, we can trust that the classifier will find it.
We can also compute the recall of the classifier using the entries in the
confusion matrix, with the formula

$$\mathrm{recall} = \frac{\mathrm{number \; of  \; correct  \; positive \; predictions}}{\mathrm{total \;  number \;  of  \; positive \; test \; set \; observations}}.$$

In the example presented in {numref}`confusion-matrix-table`, we have that the precision and recall are

$$\mathrm{precision} = \frac{1}{1+4} = 0.20, \quad \mathrm{recall} = \frac{1}{1+3} = 0.25.$$

So even with an accuracy of 89%, the precision and recall of the classifier
were both relatively low. For this data analysis context, recall is
particularly important: if someone has a malignant tumor, we certainly want to
identify it.  A recall of just 25% would likely be unacceptable!

```{note}
It is difficult to achieve both high precision and high recall at
the same time; models with high precision tend to have low recall and vice
versa.  As an example, we can easily make a classifier that has *perfect
recall*: just *always* guess positive! This classifier will of course find
every positive observation in the test set, but it will make lots of false
positive predictions along the way  and have low precision. Similarly, we can
easily make a classifier that has *perfect precision*: *never* guess
positive! This classifier will never incorrectly identify an obsevation as
positive, but it will make a lot of false negative predictions along the way.
In fact, this classifier will have 0% recall! Of course, most real
classifiers fall somewhere in between these two extremes. But these examples
serve to show that in settings where one of the classes is of interest (i.e.,
there is a *positive* label), there is a trade-off between precision and recall that one has to
make when designing a classifier.
```

(randomseeds)=
## Randomness and seeds

```{index} random
```

Beginning in this chapter, our data analyses will often involve the use
of *randomness*. We use randomness any time we need to make a decision in our
analysis that needs to be fair, unbiased, and not influenced by human input.
For example, in this chapter, we need to split
a data set into a training set and test set to evaluate our classifier. We 
certainly do not want to choose how to split
the data ourselves by hand, as we want to avoid accidentally influencing the result
of the evaluation. So instead, we let Python *randomly* split the data.
In future chapters we will use randomness
in many other ways, e.g., to help us select a small subset of data from a larger data set, 
to pick groupings of data, and more.

```{index} reproducible, seed
```

```{index} see: random seed; seed
```

```{index} seed; numpy.random.seed
```

However, the use of randomness runs counter to one of the main 
tenets of good data analysis practice: *reproducibility*. Recall that a reproducible
analysis produces the same result each time it is run; if we include randomness
in the analysis, would we not get a different result each time?
The trick is that in Python&mdash;and other programming languages&mdash;randomness 
is not actually random! Instead, Python uses a *random number generator* that
produces a sequence of numbers that
are completely determined by a 
 *seed value*. Once you set the seed value, everything after that point may *look* random,
but is actually totally reproducible. As long as you pick the same seed
value, you get the same result!

```{index} sample; numpy.random.choice
```

Let's use an example to investigate how randomness works in Python. Say we 
have a series object containing the integers from 0 to 9. We want
to randomly pick 10 numbers from that list, but we want it to be reproducible.
Before randomly picking the 10 numbers,
we call the `seed` function from the `numpy` package, and pass it any integer as the argument. 
Below we use the seed number `1`. At 
that point, Python will keep track of the randomness that occurs throughout the code.
For example, we can call the `sample` method
on the series of numbers, passing the argument `n = 10` to indicate that we want 10 samples.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

np.random.seed(1)

nums_0_to_9 = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

random_numbers1 = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers1
```
You can see that `random_numbers1` is a list of 10 numbers
from 0 to 9 that, from all appearances, looks random. If 
we run the `sample` method again, 
we will get a fresh batch of 10 numbers that also look random.

```{code-cell} ipython3
random_numbers2 = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers2
```

If we want to force Python to produce the same sequences of random numbers,
we can simply call the `np.random.seed` function with the seed value `1`---the same
as before---and then call the `sample` method again.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.random.seed(1)
random_numbers1_again = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers1_again
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
random_numbers2_again = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers2_again
```

Notice that after calling `np.random.seed`, we get the same
two sequences of numbers in the same order. `random_numbers1` and `random_numbers1_again`
produce the same sequence of numbers, and the same can be said about `random_numbers2` and
`random_numbers2_again`. And if we choose a different value for the seed---say, 4235---we
obtain a different sequence of random numbers.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.random.seed(4235)
random_numbers = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
random_numbers = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10).to_numpy()
random_numbers
```

In other words, even though the sequences of numbers that Python is generating *look*
random, they are totally determined when we set a seed value! 

So what does this mean for data analysis? Well, `sample` is certainly not the
only data frame method that uses randomness in Python. Many of the functions
that we use in `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and beyond use randomness&mdash;many
of them without even telling you about it.  Also note that when Python starts
up, it creates its own seed to use. So if you do not explicitly 
call the `np.random.seed` function, your results 
will likely not be reproducible. Finally, be careful to set the seed *only once* at
the beginning of a data analysis. Each time you set the seed, you are inserting
your own human input, thereby influencing the analysis. For example, if you use
the `sample` many times throughout your analysis but set the seed each time, the 
randomness that Python uses will not look as random as it should.

In summary: if you want your analysis to be reproducible, i.e., produce *the same result*
each time you run it, make sure to use `np.random.seed` exactly once
at the beginning of the analysis. Different argument values
in `np.random.seed` will lead to different patterns of randomness, but as long as you pick the same
value your analysis results will be the same. In the remainder of the textbook,
we will set the seed once at the beginning of each chapter.

````{note}
When you use `np.random.seed`, you are really setting the seed for the `numpy`
package's *default random number generator*. Using the global default random
number generator is easier than other methods, but has some potential drawbacks. For example,
other code that you may not notice (e.g., code buried inside some
other package) could potentially *also* call `np.random.seed`, thus modifying
your analysis in an undesirable way. Furthermore, not *all* functions use 
`numpy`'s random number generator; some may use another one entirely.
In that case, setting `np.random.seed` may not actually make your whole analysis 
reproducible.

In this book, we will generally only use packages that play nicely with `numpy`'s
default random number generator, so we will stick with `np.random.seed`. 
You can achieve more careful control over randomness in your analysis 
by creating a `numpy` [`RandomState` object](https://numpy.org/doc/1.16/reference/generated/numpy.random.RandomState.html) 
once at the beginning of your analysis, and passing it to 
the `random_state` argument that is available in many `pandas` and `scikit-learn`
functions. Those functions will then use your `RandomState` to generate random numbers instead of 
`numpy`'s default generator. For example, we can reproduce our earlier example by using a `RandomState`
object with the `seed` value set to 1; we get the same lists of numbers once again.
```{code}
rnd = np.random.RandomState(seed = 1)
random_numbers1_third = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10, random_state = rnd).to_numpy()
random_numbers1_third
``` 
```{code}
array([2, 9, 6, 4, 0, 3, 1, 7, 8, 5])
```
```{code}
random_numbers2_third = nums_0_to_9.sample(n = 10, random_state = rnd).to_numpy()
random_numbers2_third
``` 
```{code}
array([9, 5, 3, 0, 8, 4, 2, 1, 6, 7])
```

````

## Evaluating performance with `scikit-learn`

```{index} scikit-learn, visualization; scatter
```

Back to evaluating classifiers now!
In Python, we can use the `scikit-learn` package not only to perform $K$-nearest neighbors
classification, but also to assess how well our classification worked. 
Let's work through an example of how to use tools from `scikit-learn` to evaluate a classifier
 using the breast cancer data set from the previous chapter.
We begin the analysis by loading the packages we require,
reading in the breast cancer data,
and then making a quick scatter plot visualization of
tumor cell concavity versus smoothness colored by diagnosis in {numref}`fig:06-precode`.
You will also notice that we set the random seed using the `np.random.seed` function, 
as described in the {ref}`randomseeds` section.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# load packages
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import set_config

# Output dataframes instead of arrays
set_config(transform_output="pandas")

# set the seed
np.random.seed(1)

# load data
cancer = pd.read_csv("data/wdbc_unscaled.csv")
# re-label Class 'M' as 'Malignant', and Class 'B' as 'Benign'
cancer['Class'] = cancer['Class'].replace({
    'M' : 'Malignant',
    'B' : 'Benign'
})

# create scatter plot of tumor cell concavity versus smoothness,
# labeling the points be diagnosis class

perim_concav = alt.Chart(cancer).mark_circle().encode(
    x=alt.X("Smoothness").scale(zero=False),
    y="Concavity",
    color=alt.Color("Class").title("Diagnosis")
)
perim_concav
```

### Create the train / test split

Once we have decided on a predictive question to answer and done some
preliminary exploration, the very next thing to do is to split the data into
the training and test sets. Typically, the training set is between 50% and 95% of
the data, while the test set is the remaining 5% to 50%; the intuition is that
you want to trade off between training an accurate model (by using a larger
training data set) and getting an accurate evaluation of its performance (by
using a larger test data set). Here, we will use 75% of the data for training,
and 25% for testing.

+++

```{index} scikit-learn; train_test_split, shuffling, stratification
```

The `train_test_split` function from `scikit-learn` handles the procedure of splitting
the data for us. We can specify two very important parameters when using `train_test_split` to ensure
that the accuracy estimates from the test data are reasonable. First,
setting `shuffle=True` (which is the default) means the data will be shuffled before splitting,
which ensures that any ordering present
in the data does not influence the data that ends up in the training and testing sets.
Second, by specifying the `stratify` parameter to be the response variable in the training set,
it **stratifies** the data by the class label, to ensure that roughly
the same proportion of each class ends up in both the training and testing sets. For example,
in our data set, roughly 63% of the
observations are from the benign class (`Benign`), and 37% are from the malignant class (`Malignant`),
so specifying `stratify` as the class column ensures that roughly 63% of the training data are benign, 
37% of the training data are malignant,
and the same proportions exist in the testing data.

Let's use the `train_test_split` function to create the training and testing sets.
We first need to import the function from the `sklearn` package. Then
we will specify that `train_size=0.75` so that 75% of our original data set ends up
in the training set. We will also set the `stratify` argument to the categorical label variable
(here, `cancer['Class']`) to ensure that the training and testing subsets contain the
right proportions of each category of observation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
# seed hacking to get a split that makes 10-fold have a lower std error than 5-fold
np.random.seed(5)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

cancer_train, cancer_test = train_test_split(
    cancer, train_size=0.75, stratify=cancer["Class"]
)
cancer_train.info()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_test.info()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

glue("cancer_train_nrow", len(cancer_train))
glue("cancer_test_nrow", len(cancer_test))
```

```{index} info
```

We can see from the `info` method above that the training set contains {glue:}`cancer_train_nrow` observations, 
while the test set contains {glue:}`cancer_test_nrow` observations. This corresponds to
a train / test split of 75% / 25%, as desired. Recall from the {ref}`classification1` chapter
that we use the `info` method to preview the number of rows, the variable names, their data types, and 
missing entries of a data frame.

```{index} groupby, count
```

We can use the `value_counts` method with the `normalize` argument set to `True` 
to find the percentage of malignant and benign classes 
in `cancer_train`. We see about {glue:}`cancer_train_b_prop`% of the training
data are benign and {glue:}`cancer_train_m_prop`% 
are malignant, indicating that our class proportions were roughly preserved when we split the data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_train["Class"].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

glue("cancer_train_b_prop", round(cancer_train["Class"].value_counts(normalize = True)["Benign"]*100))
glue("cancer_train_m_prop", round(cancer_train["Class"].value_counts(normalize = True)["Malignant"]*100))
```

### Preprocess the data

As we mentioned in the last chapter, $K$-nearest neighbors is sensitive to the scale of the predictors,
so we should perform some preprocessing to standardize them. An
additional consideration we need to take when doing this is that we should
create the standardization preprocessor using **only the training data**. This ensures that
our test data does not influence any aspect of our model training. Once we have
created the standardization preprocessor, we can then apply it separately to both the
training and test data sets.

+++

```{index} pipeline, pipeline; make_column_transformer, pipeline; StandardScaler
```

Fortunately, `scikit-learn` helps us handle this properly as long as we wrap our 
analysis steps in a `Pipeline`, as in the {ref}`classification1` chapter.
So below we construct and prepare
the preprocessor using `make_column_transformer` just as before.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer

cancer_preprocessor = make_column_transformer(
    (StandardScaler(), ["Smoothness", "Concavity"]),
)
```

### Train the classifier

Now that we have split our original data set into training and test sets, we
can create our $K$-nearest neighbors classifier with only the training set using
the technique we learned in the previous chapter. For now, we will just choose
the number $K$ of neighbors to be 3, and use only the concavity and smoothness predictors by
selecting them from the `cancer_train` data frame. 
We will first import the `KNeighborsClassifier` model and `make_pipeline` from `sklearn`. 
Then as before we will create a model object, combine
the model object and preprocessor into a `Pipeline` using the `make_pipeline` function, and then finally
use the `fit` method to build the classifier.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) 

X = cancer_train[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]]
y = cancer_train["Class"]

knn_fit = make_pipeline(cancer_preprocessor, knn).fit(X, y)

knn_fit
```

### Predict the labels in the test set

```{index} pandas.concat
```

Now that we have a $K$-nearest neighbors classifier object, we can use it to
predict the class labels for our test set.  We will use the `assign` method to 
augment the original test data with a column of predictions, creating the
`cancer_test_predictions` data frame. The `Class` variable contains the true
diagnoses, while the `predicted` contains the predicted diagnoses from the
classifier. Note that below we print out just the `ID`, `Class`, and `predicted`
variables in the output data frame.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_test_predictions = cancer_test.assign(
    predicted = knn_fit.predict(cancer_test[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]])
)
cancer_test_predictions[['ID', 'Class', 'predicted']]
```

### Evaluate performance

```{index} scikit-learn; score
```

Finally, we can assess our classifier's performance. First, we will examine accuracy.
We could compute the accuracy manually
by using our earlier formula: the number of correct predictions divided by the total
number of predictions. First we filter the rows to find the number of correct predictions,
and then divide the number of rows with correct predictions by the total number of rows
using the `shape` attribute.
```{code-cell} ipython3
correct_preds = cancer_test_predictions[
    cancer_test_predictions['Class'] == cancer_test_predictions['predicted']
]

correct_preds.shape[0] / cancer_test_predictions.shape[0]
```

The `scitkit-learn` package also provides a more convenient way to do this using
the `score` method. To use the `score` method, we need to specify two arguments:
predictors and true labels. We pass the same test data
for the predictors that we originally passed into `predict` when making predictions,
and we provide the true labels via the `cancer_test["Class"]` series.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_acc_1 = knn_fit.score(
    cancer_test[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]],
    cancer_test["Class"]
)
cancer_acc_1
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

glue("cancer_acc_1", round(100*cancer_acc_1))
```

+++

The output shows that the estimated accuracy of the classifier on the test data 
was {glue:}`cancer_acc_1`%.
We can also look at the *confusion matrix* for the classifier 
using the `crosstab` function from `pandas`. A confusion matrix shows how many 
observations of each (true) label were classified as each (predicted) label.
The `crosstab` function
takes two arguments: the true labels first, then the predicted labels second.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.crosstab(
    cancer_test_predictions["Class"],
    cancer_test_predictions["predicted"]
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
_ctab = pd.crosstab(cancer_test_predictions["Class"],
            cancer_test_predictions["predicted"]
           )

c11 = _ctab["Malignant"]["Malignant"]
c00 = _ctab["Benign"]["Benign"]
c10 = _ctab["Benign"]["Malignant"] # classify benign, true malignant

glue("confu_precision_0", round(100*c11/(c11+c01)))
glue("confu_recall_0", round(100*c11/(c11+c10)))
```

The confusion matrix shows {glue:}`confu11` observations were correctly predicted 
as malignant, and {glue:}`confu00` were correctly predicted as benign. 
It also shows that the classifier made some mistakes; in particular,
it classified {glue:}`confu10` observations as benign when they were truly malignant,
and {glue:}`confu01` observations as malignant when they were truly benign.
Using our formulas from earlier, we see that the accuracy agrees with what Python reported,
and can also compute the precision and recall of the classifier:

```{code-cell} ipython3

# accuracy string
acc_eq_str = r"\mathrm{accuracy} = \frac{\mathrm{number \; of  \; correct  \; predictions}}{\mathrm{total \;  number \;  of  \; predictions}} = \frac{"
acc_eq_str += str(c00) + "+" + str(c11) + "}{" + str(c00) + "+" + str(c11) + "+" + str(c01) + "+" + str(c10) + "} = " + str( np.round(100*(c00+c11)/(c00+c11+c01+c10),2))

### Critically analyze performance

We now know that the classifier was {glue:}`cancer_acc_1`% accurate
on the test data set, and had a precision of {glue:}`confu_precision_0`% and 
a recall of {glue:}`confu_recall_0`%. 
That sounds pretty good! Wait, *is* it good? 
Or do we need something higher?

```{index} accuracy; assessment
```

In general, a *good* value for accuracy (as well as precision and recall, if applicable) 
depends on the application; you must critically analyze your accuracy in the context of the problem
you are solving. For example, if we were building a classifier for a kind of tumor that is benign 99%
of the time, a classifier with 99% accuracy is not terribly impressive (just always guess benign!).
And beyond just accuracy, we need to consider the precision and recall: as mentioned
earlier, the *kind* of mistake the classifier makes is
important in many applications as well. In the previous example with 99% benign observations, it might be very bad for the
classifier to predict "benign" when the true class is "malignant" (a false negative), as this
might result in a patient not receiving appropriate medical attention. In other
words, in this context, we need the classifier to have a *high recall*. On the
other hand, it might be less bad for the classifier to guess "malignant" when
the true class is "benign" (a false positive), as the patient will then likely see a doctor who
can provide an expert diagnosis. In other words, we are fine with sacrificing
some precision in the interest of achieving high recall. This is why it is 
important not only to look at accuracy, but also the confusion matrix.


```{index} classification; majority
```

However, there is always an easy baseline that you can compare to for any
classification problem: the *majority classifier*. The majority classifier
*always* guesses the majority class label from the training data, regardless of
the predictor variables' values.  It helps to give you a sense of
scale when considering accuracies. If the majority classifier obtains a 90%
accuracy on a problem, then you might hope for your $K$-nearest neighbors
classifier to do better than that. If your classifier provides a significant
improvement upon the majority classifier, this means that at least your method
is extracting some useful information from your predictor variables.  Be
careful though: improving on the majority classifier does not *necessarily*
mean the classifier is working well enough for your application. 

As an example, in the breast cancer data, recall the proportions of benign and malignant
observations in the training data are as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_train["Class"].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

Since the benign class represents the majority of the training data,
the majority classifier would *always* predict that a new observation
is benign. The estimated accuracy of the majority classifier is usually
fairly close to the majority class proportion in the training data.
In this case, we would suspect that the majority classifier will have 
an accuracy of around {glue:}`cancer_train_b_prop`%.
The $K$-nearest neighbors classifier we built does quite a bit better than this, 
with an accuracy of {glue:}`cancer_acc_1`%. 
This means that from the perspective of accuracy,
the $K$-nearest neighbors classifier improved quite a bit on the basic
majority classifier. Hooray! But we still need to be cautious; in 
this application, it is likely very important not to misdiagnose any malignant tumors to avoid missing
patients who actually need medical care. The confusion matrix above shows
that the classifier does, indeed, misdiagnose a significant number of 
malignant tumors as benign ({glue:}`confu10` out of {glue:}`confu10_11` malignant tumors, or {glue:}`confu_fal_neg`%!).
Therefore, even though the accuracy improved upon the majority classifier,
our critical analysis suggests that this classifier may not have appropriate performance
for the application.

## Tuning the classifier

```{index} parameter
```

```{index} see: tuning parameter; parameter
```

The vast majority of predictive models in statistics and machine learning have
*parameters*. A *parameter* 
is a number you have to pick in advance that determines
some aspect of how the model behaves. For example, in the $K$-nearest neighbors
classification algorithm, $K$ is a parameter that we have to pick
that determines how many neighbors participate in the class vote. 
By picking different values of $K$, we create different classifiers 
that make different predictions.

So then, how do we pick the *best* value of $K$, i.e., *tune* the model? 
And is it possible to make this selection in a principled way?  In this book,
we will focus on maximizing the accuracy of the classifier. Ideally, 
we want somehow to maximize the accuracy of our classifier on data *it
hasn't seen yet*. But we cannot use our test data set in the process of building
our model. So we will play the same trick we did before when evaluating
our classifier: we'll split our *training data itself* into two subsets,
use one to train the model, and then use the other to evaluate it.
In this section, we will cover the details of this procedure, as well as 
how to use it to help you pick a good parameter value for your classifier.

**And remember:** don't touch the test set during the tuning process. Tuning is a part of model training!

+++

### Cross-validation

```{index} validation set
```

The first step in choosing the parameter $K$ is to be able to evaluate the 
classifier using only the training data. If this is possible, then we can compare
the classifier's performance for different values of $K$&mdash;and pick the best&mdash;using 
only the training data. As suggested at the beginning of this section, we will
accomplish this by splitting the training data, training on one subset, and evaluating
on the other. The subset of training data used for evaluation is often called the **validation set**. 

There is, however, one key difference from the train/test split
that we performed earlier. In particular, we were forced to make only a *single split*
of the data. This is because at the end of the day, we have to produce a single classifier.
If we had multiple different splits of the data into training and testing data,
we would produce multiple different classifiers.
But while we are tuning the classifier, we are free to create multiple classifiers
based on multiple splits of the training data, evaluate them, and then choose a parameter
value based on __*all*__ of the different results. If we just split our overall training
data *once*, our best parameter choice will depend strongly on whatever data
was lucky enough to end up in the validation set. Perhaps using multiple
different train/validation splits, we'll get a better estimate of accuracy,
which will lead to a better choice of the number of neighbors $K$ for the
overall set of training data. 

Let's investigate this idea in Python! In particular, we will generate five different train/validation
splits of our overall training data, train five different $K$-nearest neighbors
models, and evaluate their accuracy. We will start with just a single
split.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# create the 25/75 split of the *training data* into sub-training and validation
cancer_subtrain, cancer_validation = train_test_split(
    cancer_train, test_size=0.25
)

# fit the model on the sub-training data
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) 
X = cancer_subtrain[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]]
y = cancer_subtrain["Class"]
knn_fit = make_pipeline(cancer_preprocessor, knn).fit(X, y)

# compute the score on validation data
acc = knn_fit.score(
    cancer_validation[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]],
    cancer_validation["Class"]
)
acc
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

accuracies = [acc]
for i in range(1, 5):
    # create the 25/75 split of the training data into training and validation
    cancer_subtrain, cancer_validation = train_test_split(
        cancer_train, test_size=0.25
    )

    # fit the model on the sub-training data
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) 
    X = cancer_subtrain[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]]
    y = cancer_subtrain["Class"]
    knn_fit = make_pipeline(cancer_preprocessor, knn).fit(X, y)

    # compute the score on validation data
    accuracies.append(knn_fit.score(
        cancer_validation[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]],
        cancer_validation["Class"]
       ))
avg_accuracy = np.round(np.array(accuracies).mean()*100,1)
accuracies = list(np.round(np.array(accuracies)*100, 1))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
glue(f"acc_seed1", np.round(100 * acc,1))
glue("avg_5_splits", avg_accuracy)
glue("accuracies", accuracies)
```
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

```



The accuracy estimate using this split is {glue:}`acc_seed1`%.
Now we repeat the above code 4 more times, which generates 4 more splits.
Therefore we get five different shuffles of the data, and therefore five different values for
accuracy: {glue:}`accuracies` (each a percentage). None of these values are
necessarily "more correct" than any other; they're
just five estimates of the true, underlying accuracy of our classifier built
using our overall training data. We can combine the estimates by taking their
average (here {glue:}`avg_5_splits`%) to try to get a single assessment of our
classifier's accuracy; this has the effect of reducing the influence of any one
(un)lucky validation set on the estimate. 

```{index} cross-validation
```

In practice, we don't use random splits, but rather use a more structured
splitting procedure so that each observation in the data set is used in a
validation set only a single time. The name for this strategy is 
**cross-validation**.  In **cross-validation**, we split our **overall training
data** into $C$ evenly sized chunks. Then, iteratively use $1$ chunk as the
**validation set** and combine the remaining $C-1$ chunks 
as the **training set**. 
This procedure is shown in {numref}`fig:06-cv-image`.
Here, $C=5$ different chunks of the data set are used,
resulting in 5 different choices for the **validation set**; we call this
*5-fold* cross-validation.

+++

```{figure} img/classification2/cv.png
:name: fig:06-cv-image

5-fold cross-validation.
```


+++

```{index} cross-validation; cross_validate, scikit-learn; cross_validate
```

To perform 5-fold cross-validation in Python with `scikit-learn`, we use another
function: `cross_validate`. This function requires that we specify 
a modelling `Pipeline` as the `estimator` argument,
the number of folds as the `cv` argument,
and the training data predictors and labels as the `X` and `y` arguments.
Since the `cross_validate` function outputs a dictionary, we use `pd.DataFrame` to convert it to a `pandas`
dataframe for better visualization. 
Note that the `cross_validate` function handles stratifying the classes in
each train and validate fold automatically. 
We begin by importing the `cross_validate` function from `sklearn`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3) 
cancer_pipe = make_pipeline(cancer_preprocessor, knn)
X = cancer_train[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]]
y = cancer_train["Class"]
cv_5_df = pd.DataFrame(
    cross_validate(
        estimator=cancer_pipe,
        cv=5,
        X=X,
        y=y
    )
)

cv_5_df
```

The validation scores we are interested in are contained in the `test_score` column.
We can then aggregate the *mean* and *standard error*
of the classifier's validation accuracy across the folds. 
You should consider the mean (`mean`) to be the estimated accuracy, while the standard 
error (`sem`) is a measure of how uncertain we are in that mean value. A detailed treatment of this
is beyond the scope of this chapter; but roughly, if your estimated mean is {glue:}`cv_5_mean` and standard
error is {glue:}`cv_5_std`, you can expect the *true* average accuracy of the 
classifier to be somewhere roughly between {glue:}`cv_5_lower`% and {glue:}`cv_5_upper`% (although it may
fall outside this range). You may ignore the other columns in the metrics data frame.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv_5_metrics = cv_5_df.agg(['mean', 'sem'])
cv_5_metrics
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

glue("cv_5_mean", round(cv_5_metrics.loc["mean", "test_score"], 2))
glue("cv_5_std", round(cv_5_metrics.loc["sem", "test_score"], 2))
glue(
    "cv_5_upper",
    round(
        100
        * (
            round(cv_5_metrics.loc["mean", "test_score"], 2)
            + round(cv_5_metrics.loc["sem", "test_score"], 2)
        )
    ),
)
glue(
    "cv_5_lower",
    round(
        100
        * (
            round(cv_5_metrics.loc["mean", "test_score"], 2)
            - round(cv_5_metrics.loc["sem", "test_score"], 2)
        )
    ),
)
```

We can choose any number of folds, and typically the more we use the better our
accuracy estimate will be (lower standard error). However, we are limited 
by computational power: the
more folds we choose, the  more computation it takes, and hence the more time
it takes to run the analysis. So when you do cross-validation, you need to
consider the size of the data, the speed of the algorithm (e.g., $K$-nearest
neighbors), and the speed of your computer. In practice, this is a 
trial-and-error process, but typically $C$ is chosen to be either 5 or 10. Here 
we will try 10-fold cross-validation to see if we get a lower standard error.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv_10 = pd.DataFrame(
    cross_validate(
        estimator=cancer_pipe,
        cv=10,
        X=X,
        y=y
    )
)

cv_10_df = pd.DataFrame(cv_10)
cv_10_metrics = cv_10_df.agg(['mean', 'sem'])
cv_10_metrics
```

In this case, using 10-fold instead of 5-fold cross validation did 
reduce the standard error very slightly. In fact, due to the randomness in how the data are split, sometimes
you might even end up with a *higher* standard error when increasing the number of folds!
We can make the reduction in standard error more dramatic by increasing the number of folds 
by a large amount. In the following code we show the result when $C = 50$; 
picking such a large number of folds can take a long time to run in practice, 
so we usually stick to 5 or 10.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv_50_df = pd.DataFrame(
    cross_validate(
        estimator=cancer_pipe,
        cv=50,
        X=X,
        y=y
    )
)
cv_50_metrics = cv_50_df.agg(['mean', 'sem'])
cv_50_metrics
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

glue("cv_10_mean", round(100 * cv_10_metrics.loc["mean", "test_score"]))
```

### Parameter value selection

Using 5- and 10-fold cross-validation, we have estimated that the prediction
accuracy of our classifier is somewhere around {glue:}`cv_10_mean`%. 
Whether that is good or not
depends entirely on the downstream application of the data analysis. In the
present situation, we are trying to predict a tumor diagnosis, with expensive,
damaging chemo/radiation therapy or patient death as potential consequences of
misprediction. Hence, we might like to 
do better than {glue:}`cv_10_mean`% for this application.  

In order to improve our classifier, we have one choice of parameter: the number of
neighbors, $K$. Since cross-validation helps us evaluate the accuracy of our
classifier, we can use cross-validation to calculate an accuracy for each value
of $K$ in a reasonable range, and then pick the value of $K$ that gives us the
best accuracy. The `scikit-learn` package collection provides built-in 
functionality, named `GridSearchCV`, to automatically handle the details for us.
Before we use `GridSearchCV`, we need to create a new pipeline
with a `KNeighborsClassifier` that has the number of neighbors left unspecified.

```{code-cell} ipython3
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
cancer_tune_pipe = make_pipeline(cancer_preprocessor, knn)
```

+++

Next we specify the grid of parameter values that we want to try for 
each tunable parameter. We do this in a Python dictionary: the key is 
the identifier of the parameter to tune, and the value is a list of parameter values
to try when tuning. We can find the "identifier" of a parameter by using
the `get_params` method on the pipeline.
```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_tune_pipe.get_params()
```
Wow, there's quite a bit of *stuff* there! If you sift through the muck
a little bit, you will see one parameter identifier that stands out:
`"kneighborsclassifier__n_neighbors"`. This identifier combines the name
of the K nearest neighbors classification step in our pipeline, `kneighborsclassifier`,
with the name of the parameter, `n_neighbors`.
We now construct the `parameter_grid` dictionary that will tell `GridSearchCV`
what parameter values to try.
Note that you can specify multiple tunable parameters
by creating a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs, but
here we just have to tune the number of neighbors.
```{code-cell} ipython3
parameter_grid = {
    "kneighborsclassifier__n_neighbors": range(1, 100, 5),
}
```
The `range` function in Python that we used above allows us to specify a sequence of values.
The first argument is the starting number (here, `1`), 
the second argument is *one greater than* the final number (here, `100`),
and the third argument is the number to values to skip between steps in the sequence (here, `5`).
So in this case we generate the sequence 1, 6, 11, 16, ..., 96.
If we instead specified `range(0, 100, 5)`, we would get the sequence 0, 5, 10, 15, ..., 90, 95.
The number 100 is not included because the third argument is *one greater than* the final possible
number in the sequence. There are two additional useful ways to employ `range`.
If we call `range` with just one argument, Python counts
up to that number starting at 0. So `range(4)` is the same as `range(0, 4, 1)` and generates the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3.
If we call `range` with two arguments, Python counts starting at the first number up to the second number.
So `range(1, 4)` is the same as `range(1, 4, 1)` and generates the sequence `1, 2, 3`.

```{index} cross-validation; GridSearchCV, scikit-learn; GridSearchCV, scikit-learn; RandomizedSearchCV
```

Okay! We are finally ready to create the `GridSearchCV` object.
First we import it from the `sklearn` package.
Then we pass it the `cancer_tune_pipe` pipeline in the `estimator` argument,
the `parameter_grid` in the `param_grid` argument,
and specify `cv=10` folds. Note that this does not actually run
the tuning yet; just as before, we will have to use the `fit` method.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

cancer_tune_grid = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=cancer_tune_pipe,
    param_grid=parameter_grid,
    cv=10
)
```

Now we use the `fit` method on the `GridSearchCV` object to begin the tuning process.
We pass the training data predictors and labels as the two arguments to `fit` as usual.
The `cv_results_` attribute of the output contains the resulting cross-validation
accuracy estimate for each choice of `n_neighbors`, but it isn't in an easily used
format. We will wrap it in a `pd.DataFrame` to make it easier to understand,
and print the `info` of the result.

```{code-cell} ipython3
accuracies_grid = pd.DataFrame(
    cancer_tune_grid.fit(
        cancer_train[["Smoothness", "Concavity"]],
        cancer_train["Class"]
    ).cv_results_
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
accuracies_grid.info()
```
There is a lot of information to look at here, but we are most interested
in three quantities: the number of neighbors (`param_kneighbors_classifier__n_neighbors`),
the cross-validation accuracy estimate (`mean_test_score`), 
and the standard error of the accuracy estimate. Unfortunately `GridSearchCV` does
not directly output the standard error for each cross-validation accuracy; but
it *does* output the standard *deviation* (`std_test_score`). We can compute
the standard error from the standard deviation by dividing it by the square
root of the number of folds, i.e., 
  
$$\text{Standard Error} = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\sqrt{\text{Number of Folds}}}.$$

We will also rename the parameter name column to be a bit more readable,
and drop the now unused `std_test_score` column.

```{code-cell} ipython3
accuracies_grid = (
    accuracies_grid[[
        "param_kneighborsclassifier__n_neighbors",
        "mean_test_score",
        "std_test_score"
    ]]
    .assign(sem_test_score=accuracies_grid["std_test_score"] / 10**(1/2))
    .rename(columns={"param_kneighborsclassifier__n_neighbors": "n_neighbors"})
    .drop(columns=["std_test_score"])
)
accuracies_grid
```

We can decide which number of neighbors is best by plotting the accuracy versus $K$,
as shown in {numref}`fig:06-find-k`.
Here we are using the shortcut `point=True`
to layer a point and line chart.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-output]

accuracy_vs_k = alt.Chart(accuracies_grid).mark_line(point=True).encode(
    x=alt.X("n_neighbors").title("Neighbors"),
    y=alt.Y("mean_test_score")
        .scale(domain=(0.85, 0.90))
        .title("Accuracy estimate")
)

```

glue("fig:06-find-k", accuracy_vs_k)

```

Plot of estimated accuracy versus the number of neighbors.
:::

+++

Setting the number of 
neighbors to $K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique`
provides the highest accuracy ({glue:}`best_acc`%). But there is no exact or perfect answer here;
any selection from $K = 30$ to $80$ or so would be reasonably justified, as all
of these differ in classifier accuracy by a small amount. Remember: the
values you see on this plot are *estimates* of the true accuracy of our
classifier. Although the 
$K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique` value is 
higher than the others on this plot,
that doesn't mean the classifier is actually more accurate with this parameter
value! Generally, when selecting $K$ (and other parameters for other predictive
models), we are looking for a value where:

- we get roughly optimal accuracy, so that our model will likely be accurate;
- changing the value to a nearby one (e.g., adding or subtracting a small number) doesn't decrease accuracy too much, so that our choice is reliable in the presence of uncertainty;
- the cost of training the model is not prohibitive (e.g., in our situation, if $K$ is too large, predicting becomes expensive!).

We know that $K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique` 
provides the highest estimated accuracy. Further, {numref}`fig:06-find-k` shows that the estimated accuracy 
changes by only a small amount if we increase or decrease $K$ near $K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique`.
And finally, $K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique` does not create a prohibitively expensive
computational cost of training. Considering these three points, we would indeed select
$K =$ {glue:}`best_k_unique` for the classifier.

+++

### Under/Overfitting

To build a bit more intuition, what happens if we keep increasing the number of
neighbors $K$? In fact, the cross-validation accuracy estimate actually starts to decrease! 
Let's specify a much larger range of values of $K$ to try in the `param_grid` 
argument of `GridSearchCV`. {numref}`fig:06-lots-of-ks` shows a plot of estimated accuracy as

```{index} underfitting; classification
```

**Underfitting:** What is actually happening to our classifier that causes
this? As we increase the number of neighbors, more and more of the training
observations (and those that are farther and farther away from the point) get a
"say" in what the class of a new observation is. This causes a sort of
"averaging effect" to take place, making the boundary between where our
classifier would predict a tumor to be malignant versus benign to smooth out
and become *simpler.* If you take this to the extreme, setting $K$ to the total
training data set size, then the classifier will always predict the same label
regardless of what the new observation looks like. In general, if the model
*isn't influenced enough* by the training data, it is said to **underfit** the
data.

```{index} overfitting; classification
```

**Overfitting:** In contrast, when we decrease the number of neighbors, each
individual data point has a stronger and stronger vote regarding nearby points.
Since the data themselves are noisy, this causes a more "jagged" boundary
corresponding to a *less simple* model.  If you take this case to the extreme,
setting $K = 1$, then the classifier is essentially just matching each new
observation to its closest neighbor in the training data set. This is just as
problematic as the large $K$ case, because the classifier becomes unreliable on
new data: if we had a different training set, the predictions would be
completely different.  In general, if the model *is influenced too much* by the
training data, it is said to **overfit** the data.

Effect of K in overfitting and underfitting.
:::

+++

Both overfitting and underfitting are problematic and will lead to a model that
does not generalize well to new data. When fitting a model, we need to strike a
balance between the two. You can see these two effects in
{numref}`fig:06-decision-grid-K`, which shows how the classifier changes as we
set the number of neighbors $K$ to 1, 7, 20, and 300.

## Summary

Classification algorithms use one or more quantitative variables to predict the
value of another categorical variable. In particular, the $K$-nearest neighbors
algorithm does this by first finding the $K$ points in the training data
nearest to the new observation, and then returning the majority class vote from
those training observations. We can tune and evaluate a classifier by splitting
the data randomly into a training and test data set. The training set is used
to build the classifier, and we can tune the classifier (e.g., select the number
of neighbors in $K$-nearest neighbors) by maximizing estimated accuracy via
cross-validation. After we have tuned the model, we can use the test set to
estimate its accuracy.  The overall process is summarized in
{numref}`fig:06-overview`.

Overview of KNN classification.
```

```{index} scikit-learn, pipeline, cross-validation, K-nearest neighbors; classification, classification
```

The overall workflow for performing $K$-nearest neighbors classification using `scikit-learn` is as follows:

1. Use the `train_test_split` function to split the data into a training and test set. Set the `stratify` argument to the class label column of the dataframe. Put the test set aside for now. 
2. Create a `Pipeline` that specifies the preprocessing steps and the classifier. 
3. Define the parameter grid by passing the set of $K$ values that you would like to tune. 
4. Use `GridSearchCV` to estimate the classifier accuracy for a range of $K$ values. Pass the pipeline and parameter grid defined in steps 2. and 3. as the `param_grid` argument and the `estimator` argument, respectively.
5. Execute the grid search by passing the training data to the `fit` method on the `GridSearchCV` instance created in step 4.
6. Pick a value of $K$ that yields a high cross-validation accuracy estimate that doesn't change much if you change $K$ to a nearby value.
7. Create a new model object for the best parameter value (i.e., $K$), and retrain the classifier by calling the `fit` method.
8. Evaluate the estimated accuracy of the classifier on the test set using the `score` method.

In these last two chapters, we focused on the $K$-nearest neighbor algorithm, 
but there are many other methods we could have used to predict a categorical label. 
All algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses, and we summarize these for 
the $K$-NN here.

**Strengths:** $K$-nearest neighbors classification

1. is a simple, intuitive algorithm,
2. requires few assumptions about what the data must look like, and
3. works for binary (two-class) and multi-class (more than 2 classes) classification problems.

**Weaknesses:** $K$-nearest neighbors classification

1. becomes very slow as the training data gets larger,
2. may not perform well with a large number of predictors, and
3. may not perform well when classes are imbalanced.

## Predictor variable selection

```{note}
This section is not required reading for the remainder of the textbook. It is included for those readers 
interested in learning how irrelevant variables can influence the performance of a classifier, and how to
pick a subset of useful variables to include as predictors.
```

```{index} irrelevant predictors
```

Another potentially important part of tuning your classifier is to choose which
variables from your data will be treated as predictor variables. Technically, you can choose
anything from using a single predictor variable to using every variable in your
data; the $K$-nearest neighbors algorithm accepts any number of
predictors. However, it is **not** the case that using more predictors always
yields better predictions! In fact, sometimes including irrelevant predictors can
actually negatively affect classifier performance.

+++ {"toc-hr-collapsed": true}

### The effect of irrelevant predictors

Let's take a look at an example where $K$-nearest neighbors performs
worse when given more predictors to work with. In this example, we modified
the breast cancer data to have only the `Smoothness`, `Concavity`, and
`Perimeter` variables from the original data. Then, we added irrelevant
variables that we created ourselves using a random number generator.
The irrelevant variables each take a value of 0 or 1 with equal probability for each observation, regardless
of what the value `Class` variable takes. In other words, the irrelevant variables have 
no meaningful relationship with the `Class` variable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

np.random.seed(4)
cancer_irrelevant = cancer[["Class", "Smoothness", "Concavity", "Perimeter"]]
d = {
    f"Irrelevant{i+1}": np.random.choice(
        [0, 1], size=len(cancer_irrelevant), replace=True
    )
    for i in range(40)  ## in R textbook, it is 500, but the downstream analysis only uses up to 40
}
cancer_irrelevant = pd.concat((cancer_irrelevant, pd.DataFrame(d)), axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
cancer_irrelevant[
    ["Class", "Smoothness", "Concavity", "Perimeter", "Irrelevant1", "Irrelevant2"]
]
```

Next, we build a sequence of $K$-NN classifiers that include `Smoothness`,
`Concavity`, and `Perimeter` as predictor variables, but also increasingly many irrelevant
variables. In particular, we create 6 data sets with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 irrelevant predictors.
Then we build a model, tuned via 5-fold cross-validation, for each data set.
{numref}`fig:06-performance-irrelevant-features` shows
the estimated cross-validation accuracy versus the number of irrelevant predictors.  As
we add more irrelevant predictor variables, the estimated accuracy of our
classifier decreases. This is because the irrelevant variables add a random
amount to the distance between each pair of observations; the more irrelevant
variables there are, the more (random) influence they have, and the more they
corrupt the set of nearest neighbors that vote on the class of the new
observation to predict.

Although the accuracy decreases as expected, one surprising thing about 
{numref}`fig:06-performance-irrelevant-features` is that it shows that the method
still outperforms the baseline majority classifier (with about {glue:}`cancer_propn_1`% accuracy) 
even with 40 irrelevant variables.
How could that be? {numref}`fig:06-neighbors-irrelevant-features` provides the answer:
the tuning procedure for the $K$-nearest neighbors classifier combats the extra randomness from the irrelevant variables 
by increasing the number of neighbors. Of course, because of all the extra noise in the data from the irrelevant
variables, the number of neighbors does not increase smoothly; but the general trend is increasing. {numref}`fig:06-fixed-irrelevant-features` corroborates
this evidence; if we fix the number of neighbors to $K=3$, the accuracy falls off more quickly.

### Finding a good subset of predictors

So then, if it is not ideal to use all of our variables as predictors without consideration, how 
do we choose which variables we *should* use?  A simple method is to rely on your scientific understanding
of the data to tell you which variables are not likely to be useful predictors. For example, in the cancer
data that we have been studying, the `ID` variable is just a unique identifier for the observation.
As it is not related to any measured property of the cells, the `ID` variable should therefore not be used
as a predictor. That is, of course, a very clear-cut case. But the decision for the remaining variables 
is less obvious, as all seem like reasonable candidates. It 
is not clear which subset of them will create the best classifier. One could use visualizations and
other exploratory analyses to try to help understand which variables are potentially relevant, but
this process is both time-consuming and error-prone when there are many variables to consider.
Therefore we need a more systematic and programmatic way of choosing variables. 
This is a very difficult problem to solve in
general, and there are a number of methods that have been developed that apply
in particular cases of interest. Here we will discuss two basic
selection methods as an introduction to the topic. See the additional resources at the end of
this chapter to find out where you can learn more about variable selection, including more advanced methods.

```{index} variable selection; best subset
```

```{index} see: predictor selection; variable selection
```

The first idea you might think of for a systematic way to select predictors
is to try all possible subsets of predictors and then pick the set that results in the "best" classifier.
This procedure is indeed a well-known variable selection method referred to 
as *best subset selection* {cite:p}`bealesubset,hockingsubset`. 
In particular, you

1. create a separate model for every possible subset of predictors,
2. tune each one using cross-validation, and
3. pick the subset of predictors that gives you the highest cross-validation accuracy.  

Best subset selection is applicable to any classification method ($K$-NN or otherwise).
However, it becomes very slow when you have even a moderate
number of predictors to choose from (say, around 10). This is because the number of possible predictor subsets
grows very quickly with the number of predictors, and you have to train the model (itself
a slow process!) for each one. For example, if we have $2$ predictors&mdash;let's call
them A and B&mdash;then we have 3 variable sets to try: A alone, B alone, and finally A
and B together. If we have $3$ predictors&mdash;A, B, and C&mdash;then we have 7
to try: A, B, C, AB, BC, AC, and ABC. In general, the number of models
we have to train for $m$ predictors is $2^m-1$; in other words, when we 
get to $10$ predictors we have over *one thousand* models to train, and 
at $20$ predictors we have over *one million* models to train! 
So although it is a simple method, best subset selection is usually too computationally 
expensive to use in practice.

```{index} variable selection; forward
```

Another idea is to iteratively build up a model by adding one predictor variable 
at a time. This method&mdash;known as *forward selection* {cite:p}`forwardefroymson,forwarddraper`&mdash;is also widely 
applicable and fairly straightforward. It involves the following steps:

1. Start with a model having no predictors.
2. Run the following 3 steps until you run out of predictors:
    1. For each unused predictor, add it to the model to form a *candidate model*.
    2. Tune all of the candidate models.
    3. Update the model to be the candidate model with the highest cross-validation accuracy.
3. Select the model that provides the best trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.

Say you have $m$ total predictors to work with. In the first iteration, you have to make
$m$ candidate models, each with 1 predictor. Then in the second iteration, you have
to make $m-1$ candidate models, each with 2 predictors (the one you chose before and a new one).
This pattern continues for as many iterations as you want. If you run the method
all the way until you run out of predictors to choose, you will end up training
$\frac{1}{2}m(m+1)$ separate models. This is a *big* improvement from the $2^m-1$
models that best subset selection requires you to train! For example, while best subset selection requires
training over 1000 candidate models with $m=10$ predictors, forward selection requires training only 55 candidate models.
 Therefore we will continue the rest of this section using forward selection.

```{note}
One word of caution before we move on. Every additional model that you train 
increases the likelihood that you will get unlucky and stumble 
on a model that has a high cross-validation accuracy estimate, but a low true
accuracy on the test data and other future observations.
Since forward selection involves training a lot of models, you run a fairly
high risk of this happening. To keep this risk low, only use forward selection
when you have a large amount of data and a relatively small total number of 
predictors. More advanced methods do not suffer from this
problem as much; see the additional resources at the end of this chapter for
where to learn more about advanced predictor selection methods.
```

### Forward selection in `scikit-learn`
 
We now turn to implementing forward selection in Python.
The function [`SequentialFeatureSelector`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html) 
in the `scikit-learn` can automate this for us, and a simple demo is shown below. However, for
the learning purpose, we also want to show how each predictor is selected over iterations, 
so we will have to code it ourselves. 

+++

First we will extract the "total" set of predictors that we are willing to work with. 
Here we will load the modified version of the cancer data with irrelevant 
predictors, and select `Smoothness`, `Concavity`, `Perimeter`, `Irrelevant1`, `Irrelevant2`, and `Irrelevant3`
as potential predictors, and the `Class` variable as the label.
We will also extract the column names for the full set of predictor variables.

```{code-cell} ipython3

)
```

This means that {glue:}`sequentialfeatureselector_n_features` features were selected according to the forward selection algorithm.

Now, let's code the actual algorithm by ourselves. The key idea of the forward
selection code is to properly extract each subset of predictors for which we
want to build a model, pass them to the preprocessor and fit the pipeline with
them.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

# The key idea of the forward selection code is to use the `paste` function (which concatenates strings
# separated by spaces) to create a model formula for each subset of predictors for which we want to build a model.
# The `collapse` argument tells `paste` what to put between the items in the list;
# to make a formula, we need to put a `+` symbol between each variable.
# As an example, let's make a model formula for all the predictors,
# which should output something like
# `Class ~ Smoothness + Concavity + Perimeter + Irrelevant1 + Irrelevant2 + Irrelevant3`:
```

Finally, we need to write some code that performs the task of sequentially
finding the best predictor to add to the model.
If you recall the end of the wrangling chapter, we mentioned
that sometimes one needs more flexible forms of iteration than what 
we have used earlier, and in these cases one typically resorts to
a *for loop*; see [the section on control flow (for loops)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-basics.html#control_for) in *Python for Data Analysis* {cite:p}`mckinney2012python`.
Here we will use two for loops:
one over increasing predictor set sizes 
(where you see `for i in range(1, n_total + 1):` below),
and another to check which predictor to add in each round (where you see `for j in range(len(names))` below).
For each set of predictors to try, we extract the subset of predictors,
pass it into a preprocessor, build a `Pipeline` that tunes
a $K$-NN classifier using 10-fold cross-validation, 
and finally records the estimated accuracy.

```

Interesting! The forward selection procedure first added the three meaningful variables `Perimeter`,
`Concavity`, and `Smoothness`, followed by the irrelevant variables. {numref}`fig:06-fwdsel-3`
visualizes the accuracy versus the number of predictors in the model. You can see that
as meaningful predictors are added, the estimated accuracy increases substantially; and as you add irrelevant
variables, the accuracy either exhibits small fluctuations or decreases as the model attempts to tune the number
of neighbors to account for the extra noise. In order to pick the right model from the sequence, you have 
to balance high accuracy and model simplicity (i.e., having fewer predictors and a lower chance of overfitting). 
The way to find that balance is to look for the *elbow* 
in {numref}`fig:06-fwdsel-3`, i.e., the place on the plot where the accuracy stops increasing dramatically and
levels off or begins to decrease. The elbow in {numref}`fig:06-fwdsel-3` appears to occur at the model with 
3 predictors; after that point the accuracy levels off. So here the right trade-off of accuracy and number of predictors
occurs with 3 variables: `Perimeter, Concavity, Smoothness`. In other words, we have successfully removed irrelevant
predictors from the model! It is always worth remembering, however, that what cross-validation gives you 
is an *estimate* of the true accuracy; you have to use your judgement when looking at this plot to decide
where the elbow occurs, and whether adding a variable provides a meaningful increase in accuracy.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

    alt.Chart(accuracies)
    .mark_line()  # point=True

## Additional resources

+++

- The [`scikit-learn` website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an excellent
  reference for more details on, and advanced usage of, the functions and
  packages in the past two chapters. Aside from that, it also offers many 
  useful [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) 
  to get you started. It's worth noting that the `scikit-learn` package 
  does a lot more than just classification, and so the
  examples on the website similarly go beyond classification as well. In the next
  two chapters, you'll learn about another kind of predictive modeling setting,
  so it might be worth visiting the website only after reading through those
  chapters. 
- *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* {cite:p}`james2013introduction` provides 
  a great next stop in the process of
  learning about classification. Chapter 4 discusses additional basic techniques
  for classification that we do not cover, such as logistic regression, linear
  discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes. Chapter 5 goes into much more detail
  about cross-validation. Chapters 8 and 9 cover decision trees and support
  vector machines, two very popular but more advanced classification methods.
  Finally, Chapter 6 covers a number of methods for selecting predictor
  variables. Note that while this book is still a very accessible introductory
  text, it requires a bit more mathematical background than we require.
