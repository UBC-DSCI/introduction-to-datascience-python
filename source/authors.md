# About the authors

The original version of this textbook was developed by Tiffany Timbers, Trevor
Campbell, and Melissa Lee for the R programming language. The content of the R
textbook was adapted to Python by Trevor Campbell, Joel Ostblom, and Lindsey
Heagy.

**[Tiffany Timbers](https://www.tiffanytimbers.com/)** is an Associate Professor of Teaching in the Department of
Statistics and Co-Director for the Master of Data Science program (Vancouver
Option) at the University of British Columbia. In these roles she teaches and
develops curriculum around the responsible application of Data Science to solve
real-world problems. One of her favorite courses she teaches is a graduate
course on collaborative software development, which focuses on teaching how to
create R and Python packages using modern tools and workflows.

**[Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/)** is an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at
the University of British Columbia. His research focuses on automated, scalable
Bayesian inference algorithms, Bayesian nonparametrics, streaming data, and
Bayesian theory. He was previously a postdoctoral associate advised by Tamara
Broderick in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, a Ph.D.
candidate under Jonathan How in the Laboratory for Information and Decision
Systems (LIDS) at MIT, and before that he was in the Engineering Science
program at the University of Toronto.

**[Melissa Lee](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/melissa-lee)** is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of
Statistics at the University of British Columbia. She teaches and develops
curriculum for undergraduate statistics and data science courses. Her work
focuses on student-centered approaches to teaching, developing and assessing
open educational resources, and promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion
initiatives.

**[Joel Ostblom](https://joelostblom.com/)** is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of
Statistics at the University of British Columbia.
During his PhD, Joel developed a passion for data science and reproducibility
through the development of quantitative image analysis pipelines for studying
stem cell and developmental biology. He has since co-created or lead the
development of several courses and workshops at the University of Toronto and
is now an assistant professor of teaching in the statistics department at the
University of British Columbia. Joel cares deeply about spreading data literacy
and excitement over programmatic data analysis, which is reflected in his
contributions to open source projects and data science learning resources.

**[Lindsey Heagy](https://lindseyjh.ca/)** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric
Sciences and director of the Geophysical Inversion Facility at the University of British Columbia.
Her research combines computational methods in numerical simulations, inversions, and machine
learning to answer questions about the subsurface of the Earth. Primary applications include
mineral exploration, carbon sequestration, groundwater and environmental studies. She
completed her BSc at the University of Alberta, her PhD at the University of British Columbia,
and held a Postdoctoral research position at the University of California Berkeley prior to
starting her current position at UBC.
