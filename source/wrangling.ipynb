    "can be naturally stored as a table.  In order to define data frames precisely,\n",

    "- **variable:** a \\index{variable} characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured.\n",
    "- **observation:** all \\index{observation} of the measurements for a given entity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given these definitions, a **data frame** is a tabular data structure in Python\n",
    "that is designed to store observations, variables, and their values.\n",
    "Most commonly, each column in a data frame corresponds to a variable,\n",
    "and each row corresponds to an observation. For example,\n",
    "{numref}`fig:02-obs` displays a data set of city populations. Here, the variables\n",
    "are \"region, year, population\"; each of these are properties that can be\n",
    "collected or measured.  The first observation is \"Toronto, 2016, 2235145\";\n",
    "these are the values that the three variables take for the first entity in the\n",

    "\n",
    "In R, we often have to call multiple functions in a sequence to process a data\n",
    "frame. The basic ways of doing this can become quickly unreadable if there are\n",
    "many steps. For example, suppose we need to perform three operations on a data\n",
    "frame called `data`:  \\index{pipe}\\index{aaapipesymb@\\vert{}>|see{pipe}}\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  add a new column `new_col` that is double another `old_col`,\n",
    "2)  filter for rows where another column, `other_col`, is more than 5, and\n",
    "3)  select only the new column `new_col` for those rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of performing these three steps is to just write \n",
    "multiple lines of code, storing temporary objects as you go:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r eval = FALSE}\n",
    "output_1 <- mutate(data, new_col = old_col * 2)\n",
    "output_2 <- filter(output_1, other_col > 5)\n",
    "output <- select(output_2, new_col)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is difficult to understand for multiple reasons. The reader may be tricked\n",
    "into thinking the named `output_1` and `output_2` objects are important for some\n",
    "reason, while they are just temporary intermediate computations. Further, the\n",
    "reader has to look through and find where `output_1` and `output_2` are used in\n",
    "each subsequent line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option for doing this would be to *compose* the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r eval = F}\n",
    "output <- select(filter(mutate(data, new_col = old_col * 2), \n",
    "                        other_col > 5), \n",
    "                 new_col)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this can also be difficult to understand. Functions compose (reading\n",
    "from left to right) in the *opposite order* in which they are computed by R\n",
    "(above, `mutate` happens first, then `filter`, then `select`). It is also just a\n",
    "really long line of code to read in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pipe operator* (`|>`) solves this problem, resulting in cleaner and\n",
    "easier-to-follow code. `|>` is built into R so you don't need to load any\n",
    "packages to use it. \n",
    "You can think of the pipe as a physical pipe. It takes the output from the\n",

    "> We have this note in the book to make the reader aware that `%>%` exists\n",

    "which contains the number of Canadians reporting their primary language at home \n",
    "and work for five major cities \n",

    "\n",
    "``` {r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n",
    "tidy_lang\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a subset of the data with only the languages and\n",
    "counts of each language spoken most at home for the city of Vancouver. To do\n",
    "this, we can use the functions `filter` and `select`. First, we use `filter` to\n",
    "create a data frame called `van_data` that contains only values for Vancouver.\n",
    "\n",

    "van_data <- filter(tidy_lang, region == \"Vancouver\")\n",
    "van_data\n",
    "```\n",

    "``` {r}\n",
    "van_data_selected <- select(van_data, language, most_at_home)\n",
    "van_data_selected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is valid code, there is a more readable approach we could take by\n",
    "using the pipe, `|>`. With the pipe, we do not need to create an intermediate\n",
    "object to store the output from `filter`. Instead, we can directly send the\n",
    "output of `filter` to the input of `select`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "van_data_selected <- tidy_lang |>\n",

    "\n",
    "van_data_selected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait...Why do the `select` and `filter` function calls \n",
    "look different in these two examples? \n",
    "Remember: when you use the pipe, \n",
    "the output of the first function is automatically provided \n",
    "as the first argument for the function that comes after it. \n",
    "Therefore you do not specify the first argument in that function call. \n",
    "In the code above,\n",
    "the first line is just the `tidy_lang` data frame with a pipe.\n",
    "The pipe passes the left-hand side (`tidy_lang`) to the first argument of the function on the right (`filter`),\n",
    "so in the `filter` function you only see the second argument (and beyond).\n",
    "Then again after `filter` there is a pipe, which passes the result of the `filter` step\n",
    "to the first argument of the `select` function.\n",
    "As you can see, both of these approaches&mdash;with and without pipes&mdash;give us the same output, but the second\n",
    "approach is clearer and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `|>` with more than two functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe operator (|>) can be used with any function in R. \n",
    "Additionally, we can pipe together more than two functions. \n",
    "For example, we can pipe together three functions to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter` rows to include only those where the counts of the language most spoken at home are greater than 10,000, \n",
    "- `select` only the columns corresponding to `region`, `language` and `most_at_home`, and\n",
    "- `arrange` the data frame rows in order by counts of the language most spoken at home \n",
    "from smallest to largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Chapter \\@ref(intro), \n",
    "we can use the `tidyverse` `arrange` function \\index{arrange}\n",
    "to order the rows in the data frame by the values of one or more columns. \n",
    "Here we pass the column name `most_at_home` to arrange the data frame rows by the values in that column, in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",
    "large_region_lang <- filter(tidy_lang, most_at_home > 10000) |>\n",
    "  select(region, language, most_at_home) |>\n",
    "  arrange(most_at_home)\n",
    "\n",
    "large_region_lang\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice above that we passed `tidy_lang` as the first argument of the `filter` function.\n",
    "We can also pipe the data frame into the same sequence of functions rather than\n",
    "using it as the first argument of the first function. These two choices are equivalent,\n",
    "and we get the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {r}\n",

    "large_region_lang\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've shown you the pipe operator as an alternative to storing\n",
    "temporary objects and composing code, does this mean you should *never* store \n",
    "temporary objects or compose code? Not necessarily! \n",
    "There are times when you will still want to do these things. \n",
    "For example, you might store a temporary object before feeding it into a plot function \n",
    "so you can iteratively change the plot without having to\n",
    "redo all of your data transformations. \n",
    "Additionally, piping many functions can be overwhelming and difficult to debug;\n",

    "Fortunately many of these functions provide an argument `na.rm` that lets\n",
    "us tell the function what to do when it encounters `NA` values.\n",
    "In particular, if we specify `na.rm = TRUE`, the function will ignore\n",
    "missing values and return a summary of all the non-missing entries.\n",
    "We show an example of this combined with `summarize` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we create a new version of the `region_lang` data frame,\n",
