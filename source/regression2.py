# ## Overview 
# Up to this point, we have solved all of our predictive problems&mdash;both classification
# and regression&mdash;using K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based approaches. In the context of regression, 
# there is another commonly used method known as *linear regression*. This chapter provides an introduction
# to the basic concept of linear regression, shows how to use `scikit-learn` to perform linear regression in Python,
# and characterizes its strengths and weaknesses compared to KNN regression. The focus is, as usual,
# on the case where there is a single predictor and single response variable of interest; but the chapter
# concludes with an example using *multivariable linear regression* when there is more than one
# predictor.
#
# ## Chapter learning objectives 
# By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:
#
# * Use Python and `scikit-learn` to fit a linear regression model on training data.
# * Evaluate the linear regression model on test data.
# * Compare and contrast predictions obtained from K-nearest neighbor regression to those obtained using linear regression from the same data set.
# * In `altair`, overlay predictions from linear regression on a scatter plot of data using `transform_regression`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Simple linear regression
#
# At the end of the previous chapter, we noted some limitations of KNN regression.
# While the method is simple and easy to understand, KNN regression does not
# predict well beyond the range of the predictors in the training data, and
# the method gets significantly slower as the training data set grows. \index{regression!linear}
# Fortunately, there is an alternative to KNN regression&mdash;*linear regression*&mdash;that addresses
# both of these limitations. Linear regression is also very commonly 
# used in practice because it provides an interpretable mathematical equation that describes
# the relationship between the predictor and response variables. In this first part of the chapter, we will focus on *simple* linear regression,
# which involves only one predictor variable and one response variable; later on, we will consider
#  *multivariable* linear regression, which involves multiple predictor variables.
#  Like KNN regression, simple linear regression involves
# predicting a numerical response variable (like race time, house price, or height);
# but *how* it makes those predictions for a new observation is quite different from KNN regression.
#  Instead of looking at the K nearest neighbors and averaging
# over their values for a prediction, in simple linear regression, we create a 
# straight line of best fit through the training data and then
# "look up" the prediction using the line.

# Let's return to the Sacramento housing data \index{Sacramento real estate} from Chapter {ref}`regression1` to learn
# how to apply linear regression and compare it to KNN regression. For now, we
# will consider 
# a smaller version of the housing data to help make our visualizations clear.
# Recall our predictive question: can we use the size of a house in the Sacramento, CA area to predict
# its sale price? \index{question!regression} In particular, recall that we have come across a new 2,000 square-foot house we are interested
# in purchasing with an advertised list price of
# \$350,000. Should we offer the list price, or is that over/undervalued?
# To answer this question using simple linear regression, we use the data we have
# to draw the straight line of best fit through our existing data points.
# The small subset of data as well as the line of best fit are shown
# in {numref}`fig:08-lin-reg1`.

# The equation for the straight line is: \index{straight line!equation}
#
# $$\text{house sale price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (\text{house size}),$$
# where
#
# - $\beta_0$ is the *vertical intercept* of the line (the price when house size is 0)
# - $\beta_1$ is the *slope* of the line (how quickly the price increases as you increase house size)
#
# Therefore using the data to find the line of best fit is equivalent to finding coefficients 
# $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that *parametrize* (correspond to) the line of best fit.
# Now of course, in this particular problem, the idea of a 0 square-foot house is a bit silly;
# but you can think of $\beta_0$ here as the "base price," and 
# $\beta_1$ as the increase in price for each square foot of space.
# Let's push this thought even further: what would happen in the equation for the line if you 
# tried to evaluate the price of a house with size 6 *million* square feet?
# Or what about *negative* 2,000 square feet? As it turns out, nothing in the formula breaks; linear
# regression will happily make predictions for crazy predictor values if you ask it to. But even though
# you *can* make these wild predictions, you shouldn't. You should only make predictions roughly within
# the range of your original data, and perhaps a bit beyond it only if it makes sense. For example,
# the data in {numref}`fig:08-lin-reg1` only reaches around 600 square feet on the low end, but 
# it would probably be reasonable to use the linear regression model to make a prediction at 500 square feet, say.
#
# Back to the example! Once we have the coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, we can use the equation
# above to evaluate the predicted sale price given the value we have for the
# predictor variable&mdash;here 2,000 square feet. {numref}`fig:08-lin-reg2` demonstrates this process.

# Below we illustrate how we can use the usual `scikit-learn` workflow to predict house sale
# price given house size using a simple linear regression approach using the full
# Sacramento real estate data set.
#
# As usual, we start by loading packages, setting the seed, loading data, and putting some test data away in a lock box (setting the `random_state`) that we
# can come back to after we choose our final model. Let's take care of that now.

# Comparison of simple linear regression and KNN regression.

# %% [markdown]
# What differences do we observe in {numref}`fig:08-compareRegression`? One obvious
# difference is the shape of the blue lines. In simple linear regression we are
# restricted to a straight line, whereas in KNN regression our line is much more
# flexible and can be quite wiggly. But there is a major interpretability advantage in limiting the
# model to a straight line. A 
# straight line can be defined by two numbers, the
# vertical intercept and the slope. The intercept tells us what the prediction is when
# all of the predictors are equal to 0; and the slope tells us what unit increase in the target/response
# variable we predict given a unit increase in the predictor
# variable. KNN regression, as simple as it is to implement and understand, has no such
# interpretability from its wiggly line. 
#
# There can, however, also be a disadvantage to using a simple linear regression
# model in some cases, particularly when the relationship between the target and
# the predictor is not linear, but instead some other shape (e.g., curved or oscillating). In 
# these cases the prediction model from a simple linear regression
# will underfit \index{underfitting!regression} (have high bias), meaning that model/predicted values do not
# match the actual observed values very well. Such a model would probably have a
# quite high RMSE when assessing model goodness of fit on the training data and
# a quite high RMSPE when assessing model prediction quality on a test data
# set. On such a data set, KNN regression may fare better. Additionally, there
# are other types of regression you can learn about in future books that may do
# even better at predicting with such data.
#
# How do these two models compare on the Sacramento house prices data set? In
# {numref}`fig:08-compareRegression`, we also printed the RMSPE as calculated from 
# predicting on the test data set that was not used to train/fit the models. The RMSPE for the simple linear
# regression model is slightly lower than the RMSPE for the KNN regression model.
# Considering that the simple linear regression model is also more interpretable,
# if we were comparing these in practice we would likely choose to use the simple
# linear regression model.
#
# Finally, note that the KNN regression model becomes "flat"
# at the left and right boundaries of the data, while the linear model
# predicts a constant slope. Predicting outside the range of the observed
# data is known as *extrapolation*; \index{extrapolation} KNN and linear models behave quite differently
# when extrapolating. Depending on the application, the flat
# or constant slope trend may make more sense. For example, if our housing
# data were slightly different, the linear model may have actually predicted 
# a *negative* price for a small house (if the intercept $\beta_0$ was negative),
# which obviously does not match reality. On the other hand, the trend of increasing
# house size corresponding to increasing house price probably continues for large houses, 
# so the "flat" extrapolation of KNN likely does not match reality.

# plane mathematically. We can extract those slope values from our model object
# as shown below:

mlm.coef_

# %% [markdown]
# And then use those slopes to write a mathematical equation to describe the prediction plane: \index{plane equation}

# - $\beta_1$ is the *slope* for the first predictor (how quickly the price increases as you increase house size)
# - $\beta_2$ is the *slope* for the second predictor (how quickly the price increases as you increase the number of bedrooms)
#
# Finally, we can fill in the values for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ from the model output above
# to create the equation of the plane of best fit to the data:

# ## Multicollinearity and outliers
#
# What can go wrong when performing (possibly multivariable) linear regression? 
# This section will introduce two common issues&mdash;*outliers* and *collinear predictors*&mdash;and 
# illustrate their impact on predictions.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Outliers
#
# Outliers \index{outliers} are data points that do not follow the usual pattern of the rest of the data.
# In the setting of linear regression, these are points that
#  have a vertical distance to the line of best fit that is either much higher or much lower 
# than you might expect based on the rest of the data. The problem with outliers is that
# they can have *too much influence* on the line of best fit. In general, it is very difficult
# to judge accurately which data are outliers without advanced techniques that are beyond
# the scope of this book.
#
# But to illustrate what can happen when you have outliers, {numref}`fig:08-lm-outlier`
# shows a small subset of the Sacramento housing data again, except we have added a *single* data point (highlighted
# in red). This house is 5,000 square feet in size, and sold for only \$50,000. Unbeknownst to the
# data analyst, this house was sold by a parent to their child for an absurdly low price. Of course,
# this is not representative of the real housing market values that the other data points follow; 
# the data point is an *outlier*. In blue we plot the original line of best fit, and in red
# we plot the new line of best fit including the outlier. You can see how different the red line
# is from the blue line, which is entirely caused by that one extra outlier data point.

# up the data randomly into different chunks&mdash;the coefficients vary by large amounts:
#
# Best Fit 1: $\text{house sale price} =$ {glue:text}`icept1` $+$ {glue:text}`sqft1` $\cdot (\text{house size 1}$ $({ft}^2)) +$ {glue:text}`sqft11` $\cdot (\text{house size 2}$ $({ft}^2)).$

#  Therefore, when performing multivariable linear regression, it is important to avoid including very

# ## Designing new predictors
#
# We were quite fortunate in our initial exploration to find a predictor variable (house size)
# that seems to have a meaningful and nearly linear relationship with our response variable (sale price).
# But what should we do if we cannot immediately find such a nice variable?
# Well, sometimes it is just a fact that the variables in the data do not have enough of 
# a relationship with the response variable to provide useful predictions. For example,
# if the only available predictor was "the current house owner's favorite ice cream flavor",
# we likely would have little hope of using that variable to predict the house's sale price
# (barring any future remarkable scientific discoveries about the relationship between 
# the housing market and homeowner ice cream preferences). In cases like these, 
# the only option is to obtain measurements of more useful variables.
#
# There are, however, a wide variety of cases where the predictor variables do have a 
# meaningful relationship with the response variable, but that relationship does not fit
# the assumptions of the regression method you have chosen. For example, a data frame `df`
# with two variables&mdash;`x` and `y`&mdash;with a nonlinear relationship between the two variables
# will not be fully captured by simple linear regression, as shown in {numref}`fig:08-predictor-design`.

# as shown in {numref}`fig:08-predictor-design-2`.
# Here you can see that the transformed predictor `z` helps the 
# linear regression model make more accurate predictions. 
# Note that none of the `y` response values have changed between {numref}`fig:08-predictor-design`
# and {numref}`fig:08-predictor-design-2`; the only change is that the `x` values
# have been replaced by `z` values.

# Relationship between the transformed predictor and the response.
# :::

# %% [markdown]
# The process of
# transforming predictors (and potentially combining multiple predictors in the process)
# is known as *feature engineering*. \index{feature engineering|see{predictor design}} In real data analysis
# problems, you will need to rely on
# a deep understanding of the problem&mdash;as well as the wrangling tools 
# from previous chapters&mdash;to engineer useful new features that improve
# predictive performance.
#
# > **Note:** Feature engineering
# > is *part of tuning your model*, and as such you must not use your test data
# > to evaluate the quality of the features you produce. You are free to use
# > cross-validation, though!

# ## The other sides of regression
#
# So far in this textbook we have used regression only in the context of
# prediction. However, regression can also be seen as a method to understand and
# quantify the effects of individual variables on a response / outcome of interest.
# In the housing example from this chapter, beyond just using past data
# to predict future sale prices, 
# we might also be interested in describing the
# individual relationships of house size and the number of bedrooms with house price,
# quantifying how strong each of these relationships are, and assessing how accurately we
# can estimate their magnitudes. And even beyond that, we may be interested in 
# understanding whether the predictors *cause* changes in the price.
# These sides of regression are well beyond the scope of this book; but
# the material you have learned here should give you a foundation of knowledge
# that will serve you well when moving to more advanced books on the topic.

# ## Exercises
#
# Practice exercises for the material covered in this chapter 
# can be found in the accompanying 
# [worksheets repository](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/data-science-a-first-intro-worksheets#readme)
# in the "Regression II: linear regression" row.
# You can launch an interactive version of the worksheet in your browser by clicking the "launch binder" button.
# You can also preview a non-interactive version of the worksheet by clicking "view worksheet."
# If you instead decide to download the worksheet and run it on your own machine,
# make sure to follow the instructions for computer setup
# found in Chapter {ref}`move-to-your-own-machine`. This will ensure that the automated feedback
# and guidance that the worksheets provide will function as intended.

# ## Additional resources
#
# - The [`scikit-learn` website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an excellent
#   reference for more details on, and advanced usage of, the functions and
#   packages in the past two chapters. Aside from that, it also offers many 
#   useful [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) and [an extensive list
#   of more advanced examples](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html#general-examples)
#   that you can use to continue learning beyond the scope of this book.
# - *Modern Dive* [@moderndive] is another textbook that uses the
#   `tidyverse` / `tidymodels` framework. Chapter 6 complements the material in
#   the current chapter well; it covers some slightly more advanced concepts than
#   we do without getting mathematical. Give this chapter a read before moving on
#   to the next reference. It is also worth noting that this book takes a more
#   "explanatory" / "inferential" approach to regression in general (in Chapters 5,
#   6, and 10), which provides a nice complement to the predictive tack we take in
#   the present book.
# - *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* {cite:p}`james2013introduction` provides 
#   a great next stop in the process of
#   learning about regression. Chapter 3 covers linear regression at a slightly
#   more mathematical level than we do here, but it is not too large a leap and so
#   should provide a good stepping stone. Chapter 6 discusses how to pick a subset
#   of "informative" predictors when you have a data set with many predictors, and
#   you expect only a few of them to be relevant. Chapter 7 covers regression
#   models that are more flexible than linear regression models but still enjoy the
#   computational efficiency of linear regression. In contrast, the KNN methods we
#   covered earlier are indeed more flexible but become very slow when given lots
#   of data.
